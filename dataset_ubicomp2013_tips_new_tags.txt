u2637	v278	Mamoun's is the best place to have a falafel or shawerma. Om nom nom nom.

u20537	v390	Cheese grits = amazing. Order a bloody Mary with whatever your breakfast pick is, add bacon & jalepenos
u19066	v390	worth the wait, best breakfast I have had in nyc!  the place inside is chilled, the wait staff friendly, deserts crazy good.  don't worry the line moves fast!
u19522	v390	Espresso here is really good (you can trust in a Brazilian opinion on this!). Tasty, creamy, right temperature. Really good!
u50489	v390	Definitely was good enough to eat, but I am not sure it warrants the lengthy wait.  The tuna melt was certainly one of the best in New York and the hot apple cider is nice. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

u62734	v423	JG Melon for nightcap with burger and jukebox
u68798	v423	Best burgers on the Upper East Side. Whenever I go here, I always run into someone I know from prep school or who went to Buckley or Hewitt. Small world :)

u11372	v446	Best lobster roll in NYC. Whole bronzini is the 2nd best dish. Sundae's are amazing too.
u22056	v446	Sardine special was great. Lobster roll too. Deep fried oysters and clams were only OK. Sliders were fine, not overwhelmingly great, but not bad.
u62068	v446	Lovely brunch gazpacho!
u107530	v446	I'd vote for the fish taco's as well. The lobster roll is very good, but too mayonnaisey for my wife.  And the lobster knuckles are fun and tasty if you are skilled at removal.
u11372	v446	HarryH is right, best lobster roll in the city but the star is the whole grilled daily fish. I prefer the bronzini!

u53109	v452	Amazing brunch.  Delicious Latin American dishes and all you can drink Sangria.

u223230	v482	The Steak Frites here is the best. If you're flexible they offer 50% of 50 wines on Monday - Score!
u53109	v482	Extremely busy place at all times.  Be wise and make a reservation before going.  Fries are a must if you like them well done and extremely crispy.
u61622	v482	Ham and cheese crepes were amazing.
u211609	v482	Some of the best steak I have had to date has come from Les Halles. I love all aspects of this place\u2013 especially their Bucherie (pick up your meat to cook at home) Check out the rest our review!

u25218	v504	Strongest Margaritas going, and usually have a $5 margarita special all day Sunday.
u152611	v507	Prices are steep, but its NYC so its average. Prime NY Strip Steak ($48) was excellent. Seems like I can only get good steak in NY.
u58063	v507	And MAJOR waiter fail. No spoon for my friend having soup and no steak knife for me having steak.
u58063	v507	The change in chefs is unfortunate and the service was the slowest ever. Another table left before getting food because it was taking so long.
u120838	v512	Skip the avocado rolls- they're weird.  Get the huge margarita- they're awesome!
u60601	v512	The margaritas are basic, but will do the job (and surprisingly I didn't have a hangover the next day). Plenty of vegan options and the food tastes fresh and un-heavy. YUMM!!

u29638	v514	A little bit of a wait, so try to make a reservation. Burger was big but overpriced. Brunch looked phenomenal.

u82569	v523	Winner of Best Fish and Chips in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! Get the mushy peas as a side - far more delicious than the name would suggest.

u45808	v543	Can't go wrong with brunch. Popular spot on Sundays!
u29594	v543	This is my Monday night choice!  The sushi is good; esp when you consider that is is half price!  I like the mango choices.  Also, the Rolls Royce martini is a homerun one stop doozy.
u29594	v543	I was so excited 2 get my free drink upon my 3rd visit that I dragged my pal here, only to have the server assume that I would not want the full service associated w\/ the Rolls Royce drink. How rude!
u48197	v544	Come for fried chicken Fridays!

u10932	v549	Wow! A surprisingly delicious burger!
u14964	v549	Bar Tabac has live music evenings Sunday-Thursday -- I guess on the weekends they want that extra bar space for paying customers.Typical music seems to be old-timey toe-tapping jazz, and I think it

u2367	v549	Try the mussels. Amazing!

u96156	v571	The food it's always good, and they have a pretty decent bar. Servers are always nice, but always seem to be eithet flakey or slow.
u75708	v571	So if you order a burger and don't get a beer on Monday, they charge you the full price. I don't drink. So I said no beer. Next time I'll just waste the beer. Clowns.

u211609	v578	K: The Brewery had a great vibe! I felt like I was at a backyard party and everyone from the neighborhood was there. The beers were really stellar.
u10909	v578	I'm the Osiris of this here, B.  If you're here for Happy Hours, take a tour.  The newly minted brewery expansion is very interesting, the fermenters are so shiny!

u30502	v603	A great place to meet celebrities,  cewebrites, or both, like Vin Vacanti.

u14964	v609	P.S. If you have any room left after pizza, top it off with dessert at Rice to Riches across the street. It's like an ice cream parlor but with rice pudding. Really.
u14964	v609	My favorite vegetarian pie: kalamata olives, sauteed spinach, fresh garlic. Extra sauce, cooked well done. My husband loves pepperoni but likes this pizza better.

u1090	v631	Get the Rev. Al Sharpton, fried. You won't regret it!
u135804	v631	Usually a bit of a wait. Avoid Sunday's unless you like tourists and slow service. The food isn't the best soul food in the city.
u21380	v631	Oh my god, the best friday I've had in a Long time, why? I did nothing, except go to the best soul food joint on 116th street. They don't deliver so order ahead and pick up or just go there order to g
u264722	v631	The Salmon Croquettes (Kid Capri) are delicious but the 3 half-dollar size portion is more fitting of an appetizer.

u19603	v648	I will try it this morning...
u1319	v649	I walked in and asked the bartender if they offered Christmas-style salsa dressing, and he didn't know what that meant. This place should not be allowed to use the name \
u68409	v653	Fast service, plenty of hot tea, mostly oily grub & cash only.  Do yourself a favor & stick with the steamed buns. Those are \
u88145	v653	Take some on the go.
u616	v654	If someone else is picking up the tab, look for the Pappy Van Winkle on the whiskey menu.

u95346	v654	I second the spicy cheese fries - there's just something about pigging out from a bucket that adds to the allure! My friend was pleased with the huge gluten-free menu that's mostly unadvertised.
u36758	v654	Either go for any of the ribs, or try the Rhapsody In Cue. And after the dinner head downstairs for some live Jazz.

u260356	v700	Tell them to bring the leg of duck back!  Sinfully good!

u50134	v700	First time here and it will not be our last!

u167708	v717	This is the best sandwich in queens by far. So so delicious!
u82569	v717	Get the eggplant parm-Seeds ooze out the sides, tomato sauce laps at the edges, cheese gums up the works, and the eggplant itself has dissolved into something unidentifiable deep in the sandwich. Mmm.
u1627	v718	Get the peekeye crab salad. Awesome.
u59619	v718	Ask for the price before you order the specials- they were almost $10 more than other entrees (and not worth it)
u8550	v721	Best catfish in NYC
u82569	v721	Invariably, the oysters will be ice-cold and perfectly shucked, plunked down without ceremony -- a throwback to when oysters were an everyman food. All they need is a squirt of lemon
u82569	v721	Get the New England clam chowder-dotted with chopped clams  plus cubed potatoes and a whiff of bacon. The broad bowl comes sided with oyster crackers in unlimited numbers, in addition to a biscuit
u72	v721	Kentucky honey. two of my most favorite things in the world: bourbon and honey

u10675	v740	$5 apps at happy hour = great deal
u4787	v740	This place is kind of overpriced but they have a good raw bar and beer selection. For the most part, the staff is pretty good. It's not the place for someone who needs nice bathrooms though.

u58686	v751	the lobster tempura is a must!
u40266	v751	Alright food actually but don't expect any attention from the staff. Not even standing up waving the menu seemed to help.
u9769	v751	Do not miss the Spicy Crispy Shrimp or the Big Eye Tuna Tarts. My favorite is the Tuna Crispy Rice. Make sure to sit at the sushi bar at least once.
u104	v753	The best rustic Italian food we've had in NYC. The octopus and baccala appetizers are winners and the beef tagliata entree slayed. Also, great atmosphere and super friendly service.

u111582	v769	what a lovely cheesecake! see ya next vacation :*
u202494	v769	I can't get over the rat that was seen on top of the cheesecakes a couple years ago. Google it please. If that's what their secret crack ingredient is count me out! no matter how good they are.

u2720	v769	Epic breakfast!
u9040	v770	Go to Florio's to enjoy great sigars, inside. You'll probably feel like you're in a soprano's episode. You might run into John Perry Barlow.
u205455	v771	Not as good as Chinatown, but not bad for this neck of the woods.  You can order off menu.
u50489	v772	Classic, unforgettable, and fantastic.  This is one of the top places on the bucket list along with the pyramids of Giza.  The fried chicken is a nice surprise as is the\u2026 (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
u13618	v772	With all the mobster photos lining the walls, there\u2019s no hiding the mafia connection behind this East Harlem institution - I'd buy some of their pasta sauces on the way out, you filthy animal!
u24873	v773	Try the Spicy Bloody Mary - And the adult drinks are good too... ~Uncle Deno and Greg (via @Foodspotting)
u78275	v773	Great fare, cocktails and ambiance but beware the aggressive vultures that like to swarm, then attack. Pretending to speak another language usually helps.
u8388	v773	Nice stop after walking\/studying in the NYC Public Library. Beautiful 4-season view of Bryant park in summer and ice skating in winter
u262073	v773	The bartender who wears all the different ties is GREAT!!!!

u7487	v781	The Churrasco is amazing. Finish it off with the Pastelillos de guava and queso blanco and you're set.
u89566	v784	So many good tapas to choose from. Didn't even get to the paella. Bacon wrapped shrimp was underwhelming but the croquetas were bomb. Check in on foursquare for free sangria. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
u12736	v784	Paella is delicious, as well as the sangria!!!
u50489	v787	This is where Andrew Carmellini got his start.  The food is still sublime although it is a little on the fancy side. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

u6243	v788	Bring a few friends and order the entire menu.  This is my favorite restaurant in NY.  I hate to go a week without eating here.
u17574	v788	Vegetarians should steer clear of this place. Great service and rad place but unless you want a salad or omlette head elsewhere.
u47859	v788	Split several appetizers\/first courses among your group. Then order the biggest steak on the menu. Dip the heavenly fries in the other-worldly marrow butter that comes with the steaks.
u1826	v788	Glad they finally got rid of the paper straws for their bloody mary.
u34281	v788	Large bloody Mary. Then any of the food, cause its all amazing!
u64130	v792	salads are for sharing. love the venetian cocktail. it's a mistake not to order mushrooms.  scallops are unreal, and the gritty texture you taste isn't sand; it's salt.
u196154	v792	The hen of the woods mushrooms:  intense flavor.  Striped Bass:  perfectly cooked.  The beet salad was also noteworthy.  For dessert, try the tangerine buttermilk sorbet. Delish!
u12310	v792	Excited about the dinner here, let's see if Tom Colicchio hasn't lost his touch ;)

u24873	v801	Try the Shrimp cake - First course (via @Foodspotting)
u119448	v801	Way too expensive for the tastes\/portion. Dinners had weak flavors. Salmon tartar was pretty good. Pic is chile relleno
u211609	v801	We got into Bobby Flay completely by accident. We didn\u2019t really watch the shows until after we ate at Mesa Grill, first found by checking out Restaurant Week.

u163156	v807	Miso broth is way too salty leaving my ramen experience quite disappointing... Stick to the veg dumpling soup or watch out for the salty miso - didnt enjoy that!
u163156	v807	Green tea mousse and sweet potato pudding ... The veggie dumpling soup is great and very filling for $6!
u210809	v807	The Tori (chicken) nanban-don is pretty good.

u41694	v812	Only good Chicken Fried Steak I've found in the city.
u27367	v812	I've sampled a lot to be fair & cause I was hungry, but they may have the best BLT in the city. At least below 23rd cause that's where most of my testing was done. Knickerbocker is a closetie

u122027	v840	good american spot between so many turistic places around the area! And order hot chokolate!! Beautiful
u616	v841	They split their menu into full plates and half plates, so you can order a little of everything.  Go for the escargot, mussels and filet (cause they got no bearnaise sauce for that strip steak!)

u80718	v845	The mini-cannolis and rainbow cookies are AWESOME!
u54561	v851	Not the greatest steak, nor sea bass, the wine is too pricy. This remains a wonderful brunch place though.

u72	v1241	under pressure, foolishly order something that you're not really into: oh, let's say an organic salmon cobb salad. even it out with a mimosa.
u92904	v1241	Pancakes. That's all that matters.
u82569	v1242	For Choice Eats, they brought lasagna and the crowd went wild. It's that good.

u54395	v1254	Razor clam crudo is the best

u18406	v1271	They do have WiFi but they won't share with customers...
u43905	v1271	There really should be a sign when you walk in telling you what to do - 2 separate dining spaces, no waiters visible, and a counter. A tad confusing... But it's a nice feeling space

u14249	v1282	Great place to grab a beer with friends
u33560	v1282	Sit at the bar.
u211609	v1282	A New York classic.  Stone Street itself is a time warp to the turn of the century. Blink and you might miss it.
u52970	v1282	Great service except dessert took forever to come. Dinner, appetizers, and drinks came really quickly. But over half an hour for some apple pie and some ice cream, really?

u116062	v1285	Though everything is delectable, you must order fish. A whole fish grilled. I heard they grill it first and then put it in the oven. The meat of the fish is super fresh, super tasty.
u15137	v1289	Try the chicken stays! It's awesome!

u63432	v1395	HORRIBLE service. Pizza tastd great BUT it was cold. No one told us it was ready. Then they took forever finding salt. Get takeout, ask for it hot, get a drink from the nearby coke machine and go to b

u15416	v2541	Tribeca is my favorite location. Reasonably priced wine and delicious food. Check out the ground floor bar or, if you're with a large group, the large, circular booth upstairs.
u27292	v2541	Seriously. It's like when you have an empty cupboard of food and experiment with what's left... Highly disappointing!
u23264	v2561	The best pizza you can possibly eat in New York City. Others will scream about Grimaldi's or some other place, the is no better pizza than Di Fara. Take the Q train to Ave J, you will never regret it

u1106	v3362	Great atmosphere! But pretty crappy service and the food is so-so.
u34281	v3362	the 3 different salads i have had were each incredible.
u82569	v3372	Winner of Best Tapas in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! Pair fried chickpeas with smoked paprika with a glass of Spanish red.
u16255	v3372	Best croquetas I've ever eaten (and I grew up in Miami)
u6267	v3372	razor clams.  yummm
u196154	v3372	I love this quaint tapas bar, and the menu is authentic.  The brandada is delicious, the clams are also excellent.  Always crowded and they don't take reservations.
u8952	v3372	Love the calamari po-boy sandwich. So tender
u195669	v3412	Love this place -- GREAT food \/ ambiance and very very affordable. Though, it gets very loud \/ crowded on the weekends after 9pm, so I'd go early if you want to chat without losing your voice!
u52312	v3412	nowhere else can you eat this cheap and this good - the Kang Gai is heaven.
u54488	v3412	Fried Calamai is great!! Well seasoned and great with plum sauce!
u64130	v3412	excellent thai - loved the nuur kraprow, kang panang gai, and spicy noodles (they aren't that spicy). cash only.
u54488	v3412	Calamari is GREAT with Plum sauce
u67735	v3412	The best Thai restaurant i've been to. Not to mention that it was extremely cheap, but they gave you more than enough food. For a total of Chicken with garlic sauce, shrimp with sweet and sour sauce,
u6083	v3421	Great brunch!!
u16602	v3421	Ask to sit on the rooftop and grab a drink (or two) downstairs at B61 while you wait.
u20537	v3421	Wow. Beautiful view, great service, delicious food. Loved the tamales & Huevos Oaxaca. They're also really accommodating with large groups!
u20537	v3421	Try the Huevos Oaxaca - Fried eggs over spicy beans and crispy tortillas, jalepeno potatoes and fried plantains :) (via @Foodspotting)
u34460	v3423	This place is BYOB. So i think the food is good here and worth the money, but keep in mind that this place is BYOB. And I am writing this review while i'm still here. BYOB. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
u26055	v3423	My friend calls this food \
u26055	v3423	Honestly, this place sucks. If you like Indian food you won't recognize what you're served here.
u52284	v3423	The butter chicken is amazing here. Make sure to go to the downstairs restaurant
u98138	v3423	I wonder what the utility bill looks like for all those lights. You want to go to the restaurant on the top right. There appears to be 3 others that look the same. We got to celebrate a bday! Oh man.
u943	v3432	The desserts here are ridiculously good, even though they have no meat in them.
u82569	v3432	Winner of Best Patio Dining in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! The back garden and surprisingly delicious raw food make it an urban oasis.
u55222	v3432	One day, when I am a very rich woman, I will hire the chef to be my personal meal maker, and achieve my dream of becoming an unwavering vegetarian.
u24438	v3432	If you need\/want raw this is the premier place for it
u78275	v3432	If you want to try flavors you've probably never tasted before, try the Pear Ravioli or Lemon Pasta, both incredibly tart (if that's your thing). Desserts are a home run in a new kind of ballpark.
u78275	v3432	Slap your tastebuds into shape with the raw and vegan offerings. Safer things on the menu (if this is your first raw experience) are the Lasagna and Tamales.
u3744	v3432	Try the raw lasagne (via @Foodspotting)
u7599	v3432	Spanking and Goji High smoothies are awesome.
u196154	v3432	I love the menu here, and the patio is perfect!
u11075	v3432	here's the trick to sitting outside: call to make a reservation. they won't give you a seat as a walk-in. also green apple juice & raw lasagna is sooo good.
u11075	v3432	zucchini lasagna + malbec + salted chocolate caramel tart = yum! plus, they have ferreira port. :-)
u54073	v3432	Sit outside and order one of everything. Lasagna. Burger. Taco salad. Shakes. EVERYTHING is good here!
u43127	v3432	This place is VERY expensive and all you get are a few vegetables. Not worth it imo.
u40642	v3441	Marinated Pork w spicy chilli pepper sauce served with white rice for $10.00! Music is crazy loud and yes like everyone else FAT FREAKING TUESDAYS!
u62736	v3441	This place has a great happy hour from 5pm-8pm! Order a meal and get a comp martini or glass of wine.
u174938	v3445	My fave place 2 eat when I was at FIT! Great memories...great food! Tomato cheddar soup is the best along w\/ the turkey blt!!!

u58900	v3449	Long wait? There always is. Go two doors down and order to-go.
u23442	v3449	any arepa with avocado. and don't forget to drink a michelada!
u7378	v3449	The Tequeños are like the platonic ideal of a fried cheese stick.
u231211	v3449	Lunch special for 8.50 on weekday is an arepa+soup\/salad, to stay or go. Awesome and delicious.
u6243	v3449	A15 and a Michelada make a great combo.
u42683	v3511	Get the Cuban sandwich. Wow!
u2442	v3511	if you go, sit outside. it felt so dirty inside. the food was pretty blah, so i'd say go somewhere else.
u1317	v3511	This place is the best in the summer. Sit outside, drink margaritas & beer & eat inauthentic (but good) Mexican food to your heart's content.
u4373	v3511	Try the \
u102	v3511	They microwaved the enchiladas.
u175163	v3511	One of few restaurants still open past 9:30pm. WTF? Anyway, nice server, pretty good food. Try the beans and rice with carnitas. Yum.
u5503	v3511	BEWARE:The fish tacos are really salty.
u25438	v3521	If you're ballsy enough, try the bull penis.
u39279	v3521	Get the lightly seared fatty tuna!
u59479	v3521	If you don't eat, there is a 8 dollar per person minimum. A pitcher of Ichiban costs 8 dollars. The food doesn't. The menus have gross anime porn on them.
u51445	v3524	The fake steak au poivre is a must have!
u107013	v3524	Fuck a Club Friday (www.fuckaclubfriday.com)

u1163	v3557	Be sure to get DOC pizza and Mexican Coke.
u49206	v3557	Sit at the bar, and ask for extra parmesan on your slice. The dude will freshly grate parmesan for you.
u5201	v3557	MUST try the buffalo mozzarella appetizer. Out of this world! I also had the 21st Amendment Watermelon Wheat beer - awesome!
u3266	v3560	Get the Chicken Penang Curry. It rocks.
u1768	v3575	Go to Sugar Sweet Sunshine & have a Sexy Red Velvet cupcake w their special 'Moose' (whipped mousse) frosting

u48133	v3575	pistachio cupcake with silk buttercream- drool, that good!
u17574	v3575	Spicy Pumpkin cupcake is so good. But the best surprise are the puddings! Chocolate Chip & Banana puddings give the cupcakes are run for their money!
u195601	v3575	Don't miss the pudding in the back! Chocolate chip cookie dough and cream pudding... I'd die!
u34460	v3575	This is where I go to get my sugar fix during afternoons at work. Cupcakes are solid, cheesecakes are so rich (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
u27404	v3575	You have made a wonderful decision. Pistachio for sure. Sassy>Sexy Red Velvet.
u208452	v3575	Spicy pumpkin. Just do it. There's no better option, I promise you.
u20711	v3575	Peanut butter buttercream. That is all.
u6360	v3575	Raspberry Lemon trifle was transporting. Cake in cup nowhere near as good.
u953	v3582	my fav cafe in all NYC. great working environment, friendly, crowd changes throughout day into night
u17476	v3582	Skip this place.  Make an iced coffee and hang out in your apartment.  It's cheaper, there are probably less screaming children, and your bathroom is probably cleaner.
u34131	v3582	diverse crowd. comfortable. good variety of food and drinks. always something new going on. you'll feel at home.
u49714	v3582	Prices are cheap but can do without the live band

u19997	v4156	On the weekends, don't wait in the huge bathroom line. Just go to the Apple store.
u196154	v4156	Lobster rolls, Amy's Bread, the occasional pop-up sample sale, fresh produce, a tea salon, this place has it all!
u144134	v4156	Si eres fanático del #foodporn, this is the place.
u66227	v4156	Bathrooms!
u49391	v4156	The chocolate chip cookies at Jacques Torres are phenomenal.
u1342	v4156	Bathrooms are opposite The Lobster Place. Pretty decent ones, too. (By NYC standards.)
u38724	v4156	Chelsea Thai is amazing...try the Pad Thai. Always the mark of a good Thai food place!
u29301	v4156	Keep your eyes peeled for new pop-up shops! Swing into Chelsea Wine Vault for a tasting, grab some deliciousness from Amy's Bread and have a 9th Street Espresso before you leave.

u196154	v4283	Best dumpling house in K-town.  And awesome karaoke across the street!
u40518	v4310	Delicious pasta & light salads.
u2856	v4310	Tip: ignore hostess (rude) but otherwise good spot.
u11372	v4310	The gorgonzola fondue with fries are signature. The Eggs Benedict and French Toast are legendary.
u53783	v4310	Become friends the black guy with hat. He  surely can ditch the sign-up sheet to wait for a table & get u a table, regardless of the 1st come 1st serve. Maybe they should start taking reservations.ugh
u59619	v4310	try the monte cristo sandwich- a great combination of \
u178199	v4310	House cab and start with the salad. yum yum yum
u104	v4318	10% for orders over $15 and the sushi rocks.

u30939	v4340	amazing food, ambiance & hands down my new favorite spot for a sake mojito.
u19732	v4342	Doing the omakase. It's really the only way.
u196154	v4342	get the omakase, period.  The crepe mille feuille for dessert is good too!
u193062	v4342	The Omakase was terrific, 22 pieces of sushi in all, with a foie gras that just melts in your mouth in between, the only thing is that some of the pieces were just different versions of the same fish.
u196154	v4342	You must get the omakase. Will change your life.  Also, try the crepe mille feuille for dessert. It's awesome.
u5663	v4376	I recommend the steamed veggie dumplings. Hardy and tasty.
u252332	v4376	Get 3 chicken and 3 veggie steamed, and on a really hot day get a snow ice great way to cool down

u23420	v4376	Love this place.  Steamed pork dumplings are my favorite.
u14506	v4389	If you have a cold, there's nothing better than a huge bowl of Lichee Nut's minced chicken corn soup, esp as takeout or delivery.
u26168	v4389	They reuse the soup noodles--really unsanitary!
u22719	v4392	The milk shakes are awesome and a must-have. You can even share them with a friend =)
u27184	v4392	Try the Leg Of Lamb Sandwich - Yum yum (via @Foodspotting)
u4241	v4392	They do Breakfast really well. Dinner not so much. Avoid the turkey, always dry
u31403	v4392	The worst service in the country.
u31403	v4392	Worst service ever. The place is cool, the food ok but we were almost finishing, they took out the plate bring the check and ask us to leave. Seinfeld is a great show, but this restaurant sucks!!!
u27297	v4392	The milkshakes are the only reason to come. Food was pretty blah.
u209553	v4403	Tip the pretty and friendly waitress! Nevermind the other one.
u1090	v4403	The inside is very dark.
u45210	v4403	Try the profitterol! It's very light chocolate with some whipped cream.
u145413	v4403	The service is so slow here...
u50152	v4403	Cash only spot
u6083	v4429	Artichoke dip, macaroni and cheese, cocktails
u30476	v4429	Only place I eat at in Manhattan. Moto in Williamsburg is the only restaurant better than Freemans.
u69093	v4429	Superior mixology, The Old Palamino. Sit at the back bar
u121095	v4429	A hidden gem. Check out the lounge upstairs
u10760	v4429	The artichoke dip is insanely good
u29831	v4429	Without a doubt, one of my favorite NYC spots!
u33560	v4429	the alley might remind you of the scene from Batman when Bruce Wayne's parents get killed.
u57056	v4429	Really disappointing\/slow service upstairs.
u105569	v4429	Get a lattè with your granola to start. Both very good. Then take one Skillet eggs & add a Freeman's Cocktail: rye, lemon juice, pomegranate & bitters.
u29177	v4429	good for brunch
u15416	v4429	Spinach artichoke dip is unlike any other and a must.
u5009	v4429	Artichoke Dip is pretty killer, as is the egg, cheese, and bacon skillet. Take a look at the brunch cocktail menu, too\u2014you can't go wrong with any of it.
u8952	v4429	Great food, cool vibe. Bad server last night who could not be bothered with us. Literally ran away from the table in the middle of a drink order. Heads up service is part of the experience. I'm done
u141044	v4429	The best rose and the best mussels.

u48197	v4442	Great Scandinavian - don't miss the Swedish meatballs!
u20537	v4442	Kopparberg is hands down the best pear cider. I remembered it fondly from my Stockholm trip and it was even more delicious than I remembered!

u43440	v4442	Spices vanilla möjito is such a delicious drink. Wow.
u5566	v4448	People rave about the brick grilled chicken.
u238035	v4448	OMG the brick chicken is %$&@ing brilliant. SO good. I enjoyed every single bite of crispy skin and delicious meat.
u80104	v4448	The burger, biscuits & gravy, house-made baked goods...everything on the menu was fantastic. Only glitch we found was the lack of service in the \
u48224	v4448	Try the biscuit with jelly: it's perfectly flaky and buttery with a touch of sweetness. Certain to please.

u65308	v4461	While the vanilla vanilla cupcakes are amazing and much better than Magnolias... The banana cake is to DIE for.
u133605	v4461	The Peanut Butter Pie is quite possibly my favorite, but you can't go wrong with a red velvet or a yellow daisy cupcake. Hands down my favorite bakery.
u25807	v4472	There's a cozy downstairs area behind the counter. If upstairs is too crowded go there!
u34710	v4472	Vegan Peanut butter chocolate chip cookies are bangin'. They also have great coffee.
u56276	v4472	Iced coffee with coffee ice cubes - not THE best ice coffee, but much more consistent over time compared regular cubes. Worth a try.
u86519	v4472	Staff were extremely friendly, space is very nice. Small, but if it gets too crowded, there's space downstairs, and just quiet enough for a meeting or to get some work done! (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
u30484	v4472	The iced coffee is the best because the ice cubes are frozen coffee. Also, the salads are fresh and absolutely delicious.
u50152	v4472	The arugula and beet salad was delish

u49343	v4506	The baked eggs here are amazing.
u214268	v4506	These waitresses HATE to wait on you. Every time I go, it seems like they're doing me a favor and always trying to close. I keep coming back to spite them.

u8309	v4735	The burger's are amazing. Ask to sit by the fireplace and grad a drink in the big red chairs.
u16170	v4749	Not to be confused with downstairs BLT Fish Shack. All fish is to die for but make sure you leave room for dessert. Apple Strudel in particular.

u5183	v4830	The 3 outdoor seats are the bomb
u53109	v4830	The red, white and blue is a great deal.  A PBR and six blue point oysters for $8.00.  The raw bar sampler is also good if you want to try all the oysters.  Expect a wait if you go on a weekend.

u16447	v4834	This is how Brighton was meant to be. One of the few places left with that opulent charm circa 1995. Come for the food, stay for the show, and get carried out from the vodka.

u50730	v4843	The bartenders suck balls here.  But the food is great.
u70016	v4843	WARNING: Apparently this place will give you the Real Housewife badge if you are friends with Bravo.  Not the coolest badge of honor for a 24 year old bachelor...

u45958	v4889	The Brussels sprouts with chorizo are to die for!
u75858	v4889	Ok, so this place is NOT a coffee shop.  It's a restaurant with a wonderful menu.  A little pricey, but worth every penny.  Get a bottle of wine with dinner, the atmosphere requires it.
u99843	v4889	French Roast now has happy hour at midnight . Weird, I know but who doesn't want a deal at that time of night. It's from midnight to 4am. Specials on wine, cocktails, and beer. So stop on by!

u74287	v5076	Castros is one the best authentic Mexican restaurants in BK. Hands down!
u21442	v5076	Good place for take-out, or an affordable hour or two to hang out with friends. I was a big fan of their burritos and quesadillas here but everything is pretty good. Outdoor dining's great in Spring.

u31216	v5474	Beware it's a cash only establishment but they do have a ATM available.

u63917	v5474	Leaving a second tip on this. If you like olive garden you will be impressed.
u63917	v5474	Wow. I think overrated is an understatement. Garlic bread was something my baby cousin could make. Service sucked. PASS
u43905	v5474	Don't know what others were smoking when they wrote tips but this place is NOT good. Cosy atmosphere but food is totally average. Saltimbocca was bland, service scattered. Feels like a tourist trap.

u6741	v5606	Seriously, the toffee pudding (cake) is outta sight. We often skip dessert elsewhere to come to Beast for the pudding. Also, the rest of the menu is outstanding.
u2448	v5606	They made up for it with basket of baked goodies. Yay.
u2448	v5606	Slooooooowww service.

u20555	v5744	Hands down the best tequila selection in NYC. BOOM.
u57437	v5744	During lunch time, place your order by phone and pick it up...... They take forever when you order in person!!!!!!! But its worth the wait :p
u69093	v5744	Great place, but food is far better at Mexican Radio across the street! Shredded chicken burrito is best in the city!!!

u145611	v5779	Everything is delicious. EVERYTHING.
u5663	v5779	Believe the hype. Babycakes makes superior treats. My favorite are the brownie cupcake and pumpkin cupcake (which is seasonal).
u21442	v5854	Not as good and more expensive than John's Coffee Shop but has a lot more of a New York atmosphere with signed images of news anchors and foreign currency on the wall. Owner is really talkative too

u82569	v5862	They brought Shrimp Tacos to Choice Eats- Corn tortilla, sauteed shrimp with chile chipotle, garlic, and avocado slice. Yummy!

u22056	v5863	Cheapest wine? $40. Please.
u22056	v5863	Stop your gushing. This place is seriously over-priced on all levels: from wines to apps to mains. Get on the train and go to Chinatown. Save yourself about $100 for two, easily.
u82569	v5863	This Choice Eats attendee brought Fatty Devils (Deviled Eggs) to the event and handed them all out before the night was over! Delicious!
u72	v5867	check out the ice teas here (all diff varieties, herbs, etc)
u34460	v5867	Delicious French cuisine with equally top quality wines. And they're part of restaurant week! Regardless, definitely worth the price if you can swing it. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)

u64678	v5892	Bit disappointed by Red Lobster to be honest. I personally thought that Ruby Tuesdays across the street was an all round better experience.
u250159	v5892	The cheddar biscuits were cooked a little too long...
u103216	v5892	Don't come here with large parties. Keep it under 7 if you don't want to be separated.
u133254	v5892	Never go with a starving wife lmao #impatient
u17435	v5892	Oh Emm Geee.. if you're reading this, turn around, pick up your shit, and leave this restaurant immediately. TOTAL BARF.
u61567	v5899	Cash only!!! The brunch is good, standard, a little expensive. But the actual building is very cool, and the views of Brooklyn bridge are excellent!! Definitely good place to bring a visitor.

u6359	v5900	Gray and rainy days feel like Paris when coupled with an espresso and eclair from Almondine.
u8756	v5900	So they have great pastries and coffee that's basically rocket fuel, but the most overlooked item is their soup.  Made fresh daily and delicious (if a bit pricey at $5 a cup).

u213346	v5904	Whole wheat everything with bacon scallion cream cheese

u125576	v7297	I guess we didn't have Nico.   Good food but horrific service.    Really bad.

u33560	v7455	Rent out the whole place for a private party.
u30961	v7455	Best pizza in Astoria, hands down. It's coal-fired brick oven pizza, so if you get lots of toppings on pie (especially watery ones), ask for it crispy!

u214268	v7507	Food is great. They'll show you NO love, though. Smiling is forbidden.
u48072	v7507	Yes falafel is good. Shwarma is my fav. Add hummus & beets to any sandwich. So messy but yummy.
u24518	v7507	We meant to eat BBQ and instead ended up with falafel and all sorts of assorted deliciousness. A wise, wise move.
u78275	v7519	Everything, and I mean everything from Dressler is so well executed with beautiful explosion of flavors. The raspberry beret cocktail is refreshing and light. Duck is tender and melts in your mouth.

u125191	v7519	Great appetizers. Lamb shank was alright, while salmon was excellent. Try their oysters!

u26202	v7557	Sweet tea (and yeah, chicken biscuit).
u29177	v7557	makes me not miss Chick-fil-a so much
u9686	v7557	Most delicious buttery biscuit & juicy fried chicken
u10909	v7557	Fried Chicken Box with an extra side is more than enough for a discerning pair of eaters; just get two though, you'll be happier.
u26202	v7557	There's lots of great food here, but you should only order the chicken biscuit your first 20 visits.  Until Chick Fil A gets its act together and opens a real store in NYC, this is as good as it gets.
u22719	v7557	awesome southern food in the heart of the 'burg! =)
u96231	v7557	Fuck. Yeah. Hush puppies, homemade wine coolers. Need I say more? This place is the jam

u102	v7594	You can spot neighborhood notables like actor Jeffrey Wright often hanging out here, playing on their Macs.
u102	v7594	Pet puppies, all day, urrday.
u1317	v7594	In addition to great coffee and a surly French owner, this place is typical of the nabe in number of hot mixed race patrons.
u5021	v7594	Don't sit at the counter - it's shaky. Eat the birds breakfast. Boiled egg and cucumber! Who knew?
u5009	v7594	Apparently Smooch is going to discontinue Internet on Sundays, the only day I come by to work. Looks like they've lost my business...
u1317	v7594	My favorite bite is the Tamarama, flatbreads topped w\/sliced hard boiled egg, beefsteak tomato, avocado, evoo, and fresh pepper. Comes with a Flat White (coffee). Dreamy!

u25807	v7627	Try the Thanksgiving Mac N Cheese - Turkey, gravy & cranberry. OMFG! (via @Foodspotting)
u14912	v7627	If you can't pick a favorite and you're not going there alone, consider the S'MAC Sampler so you can try eight of their most popular varieties.
u14912	v7627	The alpine is amazing...Gruyere cheese, and unbelievably think chunks of slab bacon.
u75858	v7627	Grab n' Go.  Amazing mac n' cheese.  I really like the Masala and the Garden lite.  My advice is to order out and take it to a nearby bar where they don't serve food.
u8210	v7627	Line was ridiculous, but the Buffalo Chicken mac was AWESOME and best enjoyed on the steps next door.
u22719	v7627	best mac and cheese ever! If you don't believe that you can make a meal out of gourmet Mac and Cheese, you need to check this place out =)
u30546	v7627	Stay away from the Buffalo chicken.  Its just frank's red hot sauce and cheese.  Absolutely gross.  Had to get up before I puked
u147338	v7627	Overrated. Go to mac bar instead xo
u14912	v7627	If you're lactose intolerant, consider the 75-cent lactaid pills so you don't have to miss out on the amazing mac & cheese here.

u47991	v7675	Can't beat Gazpacho and 1\/2 sandwich. Great deal.
u178972	v7677	Our waiter BILLY was rude and unpleasant. He kept forgetting coffee, coleslaw, and always made an excuse why he didn't have it.  When we asked for a soup spoon he said, \

u429	v7723	The Côte de Boeuf
u238035	v7723	The strip steak is often overlooked in favor of the black label burger or cote de boeuf but it's phenomenal! Follow up with one of the delightful souffles

u29177	v7723	best fancy burger in town

u47859	v7749	Pork Ragù and a carafe of the house red.

u40642	v9460	The sushi here is well, sushi. Good preparation but the taste doesn't really differ from too many other sushi places. Prices are a little less than Nobu's.
u72	v9460	the amber jack sashimi with jalapeño = ai caramba! (really, you can ask for a 'spicy'-anything and they'll put jalapeño on it. amber goes nicely)

u124076	v9526	Cheddar hush puppies are worth the splurge

u1317	v11846	They're famous for their burger and it's well-deserved. But don't miss the fresh ricotta starter and the \

u64175	v11860	Save 5 of their cardboard cup slips and return them for a free biscotti!

u49206	v11930	Go to this shake shack because the line is MUCH MUCH faster, and your food is ready in a matter of minutes. Not the wait you would experience in madison square park.

u55428	v11934	The employees have no communication skills, you may have to order 3 times with 3 different people.  A joke. Worst Starbucks I've ever been to.

u51537	v11989	Historical \
u22056	v11989	The $.95 after every price is a bit hilarious, I mean, glass of wine $13.95, feels a bit like Chilli's, but the club sandwich was amazing, even at $17.95.

u3266	v11990	Best tacos down in SoHo! (via Scoville)
u13095	v11990	The meat is outstanding, so order the tacos without the onions. Raw and overbearing, they just don't do the meat any justice.

u43388	v12037	Love J-curry and one one does it as good as Curry-ya -- reminds me of Tokyo but lush. Sweet marble bar and I like how they serve curry in little cauldrons. Recommend the pork but everything's good.
u14912	v12042	If they aren't busy and you're pressed for time before you catch your train or bus, they're very accommodating in getting you in and out as quickly as possible. Incredibly friendly waitstaff!

u25041	v12047	Great tapas! Tight seating in the bar room.
u7487	v12047	Service was poor. Waitress kept us waiting even though restaurant was pretty empty. Asparagus was disappointing, croquettes were good but order only brings two. Overall it was forgettable.

u105	v12047	order a Ginkas...def unique. Can is straight from Spain
u2448	v12049	Go for the burger-pint happy hour. Beautiful bar. Service is good. Great when Mom and Dad are in town.
u154689	v12049	Fresh, delicious oysters, served with bloody mary cocktail sauce.
u104	v12049	For a perfect 1-2 punch, have the pork belly appetizer and the skate entree. Both are amazing and make you forget about the slightly too cool for school attitude from the staff.

u17435	v12055	1 word: banal. don't bother with the tasting menu (we had the 5 course) -  the sweetbread tasted like buffalo wings, the chilled seafood salad was fine but blah, go with the chatham cod or peking duck

u30718	v12159	Get there \

u4693	v12268	So wait?!?! 20% Gratuity for three people?! WTF?!
u46440	v12269	They add 20% for parties of 4 or more automatically then provide terrible service. I guess they figure they can get away with it because of the fine print on their menu.

u242207	v12542	Jenny is awesome love coming by to chat with her
u27404	v12543	One of Manhattan's best coffee spots in such a weird, nondescript locale. They have pourovers here, but more important to me is the cold-brew. Hard to find as good a cup of iced coffee.

u1088	v12556	Try the lamb burger with goat cheese.
u39879	v12568	Go to Martha's.  Get yourself one of their pecan torts.  Like a little mini pecan pie but with a thick, crunchy solid crust and thick pecan layer that gives a wonderful chew.
u222469	v12568	The AS choice: Red Velvet cupcake, Kitchen Sink cookie, and a Black & White cupcake!
u222469	v12568	The \
u4787	v12568	Tripp is a fan if the giant chocolate chip cookie. They warm them up btw so they are extra gooey.

u242835	v12598	I didn't love it. The food was bland and lacked even an attempt  at authenticity.
u72	v12608	can't go wrong with lunch here. i almost always get the steamed dumplings and red curry pair
u129	v12608	The drunk man noodles are your friend.

u41875	v12612	Come after the lunch rush, it's nice and quiet.
u30502	v12612	Ask for a side of bread if you get a salad. It comes from the delicious Balthazar Bakery!

u5021	v12617	Get the kale and the potato hash
u616	v12621	If you order anything but the Fried Pork Chop for brunch, you're really missing out (okay, maybe the poached eggs too). Bloody Mary's (even the one with the oyster) are just so-so...
u82569	v12621	Try the brown butter, corn, and mushroom linguine-auced in a rich slurry of brown butter and corn milk, which pools at the bottom of the plate, where it's soaked up by feathery chanterelles.
u104	v12621	You haven't lived until you've had a katsu-style deep fried pork chop & cheddar waffle for breakfast.

u5009	v12621	My favorite: make your partner order the pancakes (delicious), and you order the hash (best I've had). Split and enjoy.
u58758	v12621	The Classic Bloody Mary is probably the best I've had. Perfect amount of spice. Pickle Garnish too.
u36073	v12621	Free mimosa or bellini with your Sunday brunch, but not until after 12:00 pm. House rules.
u2720	v12621	Tasty scallops

u14324	v12621	Try: sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes, duck meatloaf and their dark and stormy. You will not regret. Go to Mini Bar for a drink if there is a long wait for table; they'll call you when ready.
u556	v12621	At $11 with cheese, I think their burger is one of the best deals in the city. If you want a great vibe restaurant and don't want to spend $125 on dinner for two.. get the burger!
u103216	v12625	Pinwheels are great but the wings suck. Your better off hopping the F train to Bergen for Atomic Wings if u really want chicken.
u459	v12625	They have great chili but don\u2019t advertise it on the board.
u61567	v12625	Convenient, easy, good pizza place. Wish it was open later!

u104	v12636	The meatloaf breakfast sandwich sound crazy but it'll blow your mind.
u42283	v12636	Veggie burger is superb; fresh handmade goodness with avocado, melted cheese & fresh tomato..beautiful lunchtime fix.
u104	v12636	If they have their breakfast burrito (w\/ chicken chorizo) special rolling, get that shiz in your belly!
u52312	v12636	Don't way the muffins unless ur a fan of larva
u149253	v12636	Staff nice, food great, but the pace of food service is unbearably slow
u6236	v12636	no laptop rule til 230pm; this for night owls who are just waking up

u22595	v12641	Sour berry cocktail is the way to go. Muddled berries... yum.
u8466	v12653	expect a wait until about 10pm, but if you wait, definitely get the soup dumplings

u197679	v12700	Very busy during lunch hours, but the burgers are delicious and worth the wait.
u86519	v12700	Shakes are good, sandwiches are good. Just reminds me of a 5 Guys... Nothin special... There are better places with better selections in New York City than here... (1 of 4 petals via Fondu)
u139930	v12700	I like the Grilled 4 Cheese sandwich with bacon.
u1342	v12700	Don't overlook the hot dogs here. Perfectly grilled!

u22938	v12700	get the fresh market salad. it's plenty of food and it's so filling that you don't need to add any protein!

u59612	v12700	The Classic Schnipper is incredible. Top-5 burger all time.
u64805	v12700	Sit in the kids seats
u25948	v12700	The regular size macaroni is big enough for two people. Have the side size for individual servings.

u73518	v12719	This Starbucks is one of my favorites...
u12215	v12719	Try the Cupcakes - Peanut Butter Cupcake. I heart Starbucks.  (via @Foodspotting)

u58	v12735	They've currently got a deal running where you can get a three course dinner (app, entre, dessert) for 19 bucks Sunday through Thursday.
u1296	v12741	The truffle grilled cheese may have been inspired by a lascivious Chuck Bass scene in Gossip Girl, but it really is that good. Enjoy with a sidecar or glass of red wine.
u8388	v12741	Impressive, ornate, and romantic place to start or end a midtown NYC evening
u8388	v12741	Sadly Gilt is closed for the summer - come back in the fall!

u4546	v12903	Wifi password: sheeplove.  No joke.
u19732	v12903	Really great drip coffee from direct trade blah blah blah. Basically this coffeshop signals the incredible decadence of our society. Love it therefore
u8210	v12903	Best coffee I've had.
u86519	v12903	They are serious about their coffee here!! Good thing too, cause I like it that way! Low key, free wifi, but don't order food--$10 for a simple sliced bread sandwich?!?\u2026 (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
u149548	v12903	When they have it, La Perla de Oaxaca (it's Mexican coffee) is incredible.
u29301	v12903	Any drink ordered here will be superbly prepared and delicious. Friendly service, the place has an excellent vibe!  It does get quite busy; enjoy a quieter setting downstairs. Dig the light fixtures.
u68	v12903	Say hello to my daughter while you're there.  This is her local haunt.  Quiet, pretty blonde reading a book.
u54949	v12903	Great coffee! Definitely mix it up. Get a cortado or macchiato...great coffee art from skilled baristas! Great vibe, but check out downstairs too for a chiller area.
u43293	v12906	You'll need to make some noise to keep your water glass full, but other than that Menkui Tei is a solid, happy Japanese restaurant with food that's ordinary in Japan but much appreciated stateside.
u138382	v12906	There are \

u13095	v12914	Chorizo burrito: get it. packed with guacamole and well-seasoned meat
u38956	v12914	The food is absolutely horrid. The service and margaritas are also really bad. The restaurant itself is nice and has wonderful patio. If you go, just don't eat...
u13999	v12927	The best coffee in the hood (D'Amico BBTP blend) and perfect coffee lids (most of the time)!
u206777	v12927	It's all about the French toast bagel.
u187044	v12927	The breakfast wraps are good but the bagels are lame.
u556	v12927	Nice people but a bit aloof, coffee spilled on counter wasn't cleaned and they charged me twice for a sandwich and wouldn't have caught it themselves if I hadnt brought it to the cashiers attention

u1404	v12989	It's OK that you've never heard of Il Porto, because it hasn't been around forever. But if you want some of the best pizza NYC has to offer be sure to stop here -- it's cheap.
u6359	v12989	Pizza is pretty good, but skip the desserts. Worst cannoli I've ever had.
u72	v12991	after a long ride, try something simple like their take on a lemonade: purified water, lemon juice, agave. i tried the heavier combinations and i just couldn't take it (need to get used to the tastes)
u1296	v12991	The Peaches and Dreams smoothie with an added liver detox boost will zap away your hangover like fairy dust!
u13880	v12991	The Grasshopper is a perfect post workout refresher... Spend the extra 50cent for the large drink, its worth it.

u1671	v13016	Great for breakfast meetings in mid-town, lots of space, great coffee & service.
u24317	v13016	Great place for a dinner date or a lunch work meeting. I highly recommend the Rock Shrimp Risotto.

u65308	v13028	The birthday cake flavor is to die for!
u2772	v13033	new favorite restaurant in williamsburg

u19066	v13047	great drinks, but it's a pretty small place

u82569	v13074	Try the Fried Ipswich clams-a pile of the fat clams, fried in a light, crisp cracker coating. Tartar sauce with chopped pickles comes on the side, but you hardly need it
u19732	v13074	Ed's Lobster Bar concept expands to it's third location on one of the best eating blocks in the city. Clean. Fresh. Inviting. Impeccable food. Order anything. Be happy.
u55222	v13074	A rename suggestion: Ed's-ice cream sandwich I wish I could have sex with-Bar
u191	v13074	make sure you try fried oyster sliders, Ed recommended them
u8466	v13074	Get the lobster meatballs if they're offering them (wed and sat usually) but make sure you have someone to share them with. Also try the oyster sampler.

u95346	v13108	I don't even KNOW what's on the menu besides two squares and a rainbow (chocolate, vanilla, pistachio) spumoni. Bring home half a tray and a quart of spumoni for those unwilling to make the trek here.
u153770	v13108	Get the square slice.sit outside.people watch.
u49177	v13108	Def the best sicilian slice I've ever had. The regular slice is decent but when eating here your best bet is the sicilian. Your taste buds will thank you later.

u82113	v13209	Nice if Jamba offered rice or almond milk for those of us who avoid soy.
u4787	v13209	I think they have jumped the shark. The whole franchise has really let itself go. I miss 2000 when they were immaculate, high quality and moderately priced.
u116062	v13209	Earl grey tea and soy milk. Yep. Tea. Suck it.
u104832	v13212	The half caprese sandwich on multigrain is to die for... So fresh and delicious!

u5009	v13233	No bells & whistles\u2014just fantastic coffee.

u8466	v13245	The only chick-fil-a in NYC. No need for an NYU ID, just walk in.
u42214	v13245	Check out NYC's only Chick-fil-A. It's inside a dorm but open to the public. Go straight in until you hit the food court, then turn right. If you reach the kosher area you've gone too far!
u47378	v13245	If you ask for sauce they will peer pressure you into getting two of each one.
u27769	v13245	Closed on NYU holidays and breaks. Also closed on Sundays (duh) and they close at 3pm on Fridays.

u59619	v13263	Not overly crowded, tummy coffee, and great almond croissant! Cash only.
u59867	v13263	One of the best in city. The people here love their jobs and it shows. Plus I love to support businesses that embrace tech - they use a square and ipad instead of cash register. Love it.

u27297	v13341	As a creature of habit, I tend to opt for the Chicken Milanese, and am never disappointed.

u178106	v13359	flavorful soup base. chasuu and noodles are cold...
u53109	v13359	Their lunch special is a must.  Ramen + Rice Bowl + Salad for as low as $14.50. There are slightly more expensive combinations depending on the ramen.

u204573	v13363	Found bugs in rice

u55222	v13396	send hangovers back to the hole they crawled from with the carrot\/apple\/ginger juice.

u87740	v13406	24h, good food - also called \
u54289	v13407	Good service. I recommend the linguini w\/ white clam sauce. The grilled salmon is very undercooked & steam broccoli is too hard.

u91070	v15606	Must have sides are the sweet potatoes and the mac & cheese.

u173878	v15862	My favorite chili relleno in the city!  Ask if the limoncello ginger margarita is one of the day's specials - it's a great way to start OR end your meal.
u65695	v15862	Very mediocre food.
u19408	v15876	surprisingly good lunch in midtown
u207922	v15892	I'd much rather eat here than the overrated, overpriced Carnegie Deli nearby. The staff here at Park Cafe are warm and down to earth. I feel like I'm with family here.
u51971	v15900	This has been one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken for a while. ALWAYS get the guacamole & order the Tijuana combo if you want to try a few things. Delish & great spot to take out of towners!

u5833	v15901	Get the guacamole. Incredible.

u23014	v16020	The burger

u31304	v21795	Yep barista was friendly as fuck. Latte was quality too. Recommend.
u2720	v21795	Dark, wet October afternoon outside. Inside, the barista has The Beatles on shuffle and happens to be an Arsenal supporter to boot.

u2709	v21817	I'm sure the food is lovely but it's just about the worst take out service in New York.
u148377	v21817	The spicy chicken empanada is a favorite - very small and always a wait but worth it!!

u69836	v21831	The old-fashioned pizza is amazing!
u25	v21833	Great place, but a few items fall short. Stuffed mushrooms lack a variety of flavors and, even though not fried, are sitting in a pool of oil.
u23487	v21833	The food is ok but the servers are Yummi - wink*-
u98314	v21833	All around bad time. Looks were deceiving. Food and service was awful. We waited for like 10 min before anyone noticed we wanted to be seated, there was no host. Stuffed mushrooms were freezer burnt.
u83311	v21841	Really good pizza in the city with a really cool wood fire oven behind the bar.
u78275	v21841	Strawberry lemonade is sweet but rocks the house. If you want bread, you have to ask for it, it's their policy.

u11306	v22214	The oatmeal is a must for breakfast.

u31686	v22218	Ordering online means nothing here apparently #fail
u39957	v22218	Steak was too spicy for me, and I've loved the steak at other Chipotle places. Won't stop me from coming back, though. A little pricey, but what can you do? It's SoHo.

u18885	v22366	save room for dessert - the chocolate pudding is AMAZING
u16035	v22366	doesn't recommend waiting in the lounge adjacent to hotel lobby. It's dark and secluded. Best suited for couples wanting privacy as they decide between his place, hers or getting a room.
u16035	v22366	highly recommends the lobster stew. It's a little bit messy but well worth the experience.
u90814	v22424	Great bagels!!! I've even become a huge fan of whole wheat everything!!!!

u24296	v22463	Try the spaghetti.
u11315	v22463	Forget Disneyland. I think Vanessa's Dumplings must be the happiest place on earth. Where else can you get a hearty and tasty dinner for $7, including tip? I recommend any sesame pancake sandwich.
u9962	v22463	Get the tea milk its particularly good here. But I might b spoiled by better chinatown dumplings these r meh ok.

u82569	v22596	Fish 'n' chips come encased in a beer-battered, deeply tanned crust that's salty & thick, & answers each bite w\/ a lusty crunch. The fish is buttery & pliant, w\/ house-made tartar sauce & malt vinegar

u38305	v22659	The choco frosting with toasted coconut cupcake is the best

u59867	v22715	Excellent thin crust pizza. Highly recommend the meat lover's pie.
u49177	v22722	Do yourself a favor and do not get the hot wings. Your mouth will be burning for a long time
u48276	v22722	Garlic Wings tasted like or better yet was smothered in balsamic vinegrette tasting sauce.  No garlic taste what so ever.  Chipotle wings much better!
u83935	v22722	I have finally discovered good salsa above the Mason-Dixon! It is here and it is green...get it.
u39105	v22722	The service is pretty bad and there are speakers where there should be TVs but the torta el diablo aint bad

u79642	v22804	Good food, staff has barely contained rage.

u64600	v22805	Lamb and veg pie. And a sausage roll. Brings me back to my old tuck shop of high school days.
u211609	v22812	One of the better meals I have eaten. An all around stunner from the quaint restaurant to the perfectly prepared food. I am tempted to stop in for a glass of wine and the Tabla de Embutidos y Queso ev
u556	v22812	The octopus salad was truly amazing and the steak for two was one of the better steaks we've had in the city!

u27297	v22821	BBQ chicken burrito, wheat tortilla, brown rice. Yum!
u59679	v22821	I was not pleased both times I've been here. Why is good Mexican food so hard to find on the east coast
u27297	v22821	Avoid the guacamole -- bland -- but do try the chicken soup when they actually have it.
u23909	v22821	Food is good but the service is poor. From an outsiders prospective it looks like they need a manager.
u26759	v22859	No seasonal fruit in the winter...

u73726	v23026	Energy Bagel is great w\/ C CHZ n Straw' Pers'. Get a hot coffee too.

u1731	v23049	The Greek burger is a surprise favorite for me. The intermingling of the feta, beef & black olives form a unique flavor combination that hits you on the first bite and hits harder on the second bite.
u49805	v23055	Roasted garlic and onion knish is OUT OF THIS WORLD good.
u50489	v23055	If you like a Knish, this is the best place to go.  Get the kasha Knish or the original. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

u206530	v23119	Great vibe, great pastries, friendly staff, incredible coffee. I'm obsessed!
u134677	v23119	Ask for a punchcard cuz they don't give them to everyone

u64892	v23124	Surprisingly cheap and tasty Stuffed Croissant French Toast.
u9803	v23124	Free Wifi, Overpriced everything else.
u53938	v23136	They make a mean Italian sub. Love the fries! If you do take out call ahead. It's more of a dine-in spot then take out.
u1163	v23136	Check out the shuffleboard downstairs.
u41875	v23138	Singha in a cold glass is a must!
u56222	v23167	Still the best burger in NYC!!!!
u288	v23167	Slightly pretentious, totally delicious.
u1537	v23187	Make sure you notice the (now) vintage 80s artwork. This place is frozen in a very different time.
u4787	v23207	Good quality but pricey for what you get. You'll need an extra slice on top of whatever you regularly order. If not, you will leave hungry. Been around forever though. Just rennovated this year.
u11206	v23207	BBQ chicken pizza is great!
u72	v23209	start with the hot peppers
u9	v23209	The Akamaru Modern ramen was Tge best ramen I had outside of Japan, although I am sure the others are amazing too!  Get the extra special pork belly, if you know what I mean!
u122031	v23209	You can't go wrong with the Shiromaru Classic ramen.

u80608	v23209	pork buns are amazing.
u11315	v23209	The Akumaru Modern is so so delicious. Charming ambiance, and everything on the menu seemed pretty awesome if the Akumaru doesn't float yer boat.
u17435	v23209	the best ramen joint on the island of Manhattan. my recommendation is the Shiromaru Hakata Classic, spice it up by adding Kakuni.
u14175	v23209	Succumb to the porky goodness that is the Akamaru Modern. Oh, and don't forget the pork buns.
u1088	v23209	Last call at 10:30 on sunday night
u49464	v23220	Service is pretty bad. Very slow.

u14506	v25864	I live a block from Court Street Bagels. I've certainly tried their bagels many times. There is no comparison. That's why I walk seven blocks to La Bagel Delight every time I want a good bagel.

u25807	v26051	The best bagels in NYC live here. They don't toast so don't even think about asking. Weekend lines are long but it's worth the wait.

u56171	v28415	A Great cappuccino but at 4.50 it's a bit much especially if you have had any of the new coffee shop's cappuccinos. Like Stumptown, Gimme Coffee or even Joe's. They are all better and less &$&

u50913	v30926	Rude treatment, not coming back
u75858	v30926	Get Ramen.  This a ramen shop.  Reminds me of the ones in japan.  Counter seating only, narrow, and awesome noodles.
u4697	v30926	Not every Ramen is $6.50 on Mon, but I still loved my warming Mabu Ramen on the first nasty day of winter. Perfectly delicious!
u193062	v30926	Nothing particularly special but pretty damn good, good deal.
u51939	v30941	Order a mini version of every dessert and you'll have a lovely little dessert sampler!
u261897	v30941	I like the fruit tarts -- I take some home whenever I visit NY. My friends like the cheesecake and I would have to agree with them!
u34119	v30941	They have really good Italian ices, and a large is only $2.50. I've found my go-to summer treat.
u27404	v30986	My morning Starbucks spot for some time. No bathroom, no toaster. Gets you your fix fast though.
u49714	v30990	2 for one specials
u82569	v31027	Get the pickle dog-a Hartmann's frank which is boiled, basted with butter and lard, and then topped it with three pickloid substances: brine-pickle spears, sliced dill pickles, & a sweet pickle relish
u1878	v31027	The Six Point Bark Red Ale is specially brewed just for Bark, and it's delicious!
u104	v31027	Be sure to have the Pork Belly sandwich.
u104	v31027	Bark's naturally got great dogs, but their burger also happens to be the best in the neighborhood.
u104	v31027	Behold this amazing burger. Now order one.
u7378	v31027	Best high-end approximation of an in-n-out burger one can find.
u104	v31027	Get one free refill on your iced teas. Good stuff.
u4663	v31027	The Bark Dog is divine. Seriously, I saw Jesus Christ himself when I took a bite.
u184814	v31027	Try the bark dog. And the chilli cheese dog.
u2448	v31027	Brautwurst is rockin with bacon braised sauerkraut (thanks Tony!)
u5021	v31027	Ask for the Otis Shake (it's not on the menu).
u104	v31027	Another place you might not think would have great coffee, but they do and in the warmer months, they roll out the cold brew.
u26015	v31027	Roasted cauliflower is a tangy surprise!
u2448	v31027	Thumbs up to the new Slamwich!

u22601	v31045	Great staff. Always happy at lunch rush hour (:
u25094	v31045	Like most places in this part of NYC, not a destination but a refuge when you're lost in Kips Bay. Good bagels, very good sandwiches and outstanding & courteous service. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
u46145	v31047	Brigitte is tops. Remembers my order and keeps my bagel warm if I'm running late.
u39301	v31047	Iced HAZELNUT coffee is the only way!
u42214	v31052	Use the hidden cash register opposite the panini grills. It's cash-only but will save you some time.
u27404	v31112	Seems everyone agrees. The queeny baristas here will get your order wrong and roll their eyes when you try to correct them.
u48217	v31112	Less crowded than the 16th & 8th location.
u102859	v31112	They removed all electric sockets... This Mother Freakers, bring EXTRA batteries, and write a complaint. At least off peak hours, i need to plug

u131334	v31164	Get an appetizer and half portioned donburi for a complete meal...
u22056	v31164	The katsu don was pretty good. For $12 I guess I can't complain. Large beers are steins, not pints.
u117997	v31167	The ONLY place to eat in NYC! No bullshit.
u15440	v31167	Best naan bread. Mushroom saag amazing. Well priced and equally good valued wine list.
u20397	v31314	The Mediterranean vege burger with dill dressing was quite tasty! Affordable & quick, too.

u60682	v31453	Borderline shady seating scene upstairs, but decent.

u17939	v31517	Owner is not rude; he's efficient and keeps the line moving! Fuggedaboudit!

u20537	v31671	Order sweet tea vodka with lemonade and sing along to Sweet Caroline (whoa oh ohhh)
u16602	v31671	The Wild Park sandwich is pretty damn good. Substitute tater tots for the salt & vinegar chips.
u27404	v31671	Make sure to get the Jalapeño Bottle Caps. Yum.
u43127	v31671	Pulled chicken isn't pulled. It's more like diced.
u7599	v31671	If you have a hankering for a pulled pork sandwich, look elsewhere.
u6344	v31671	Try the cornbread. Incredible. Best I've ever had.
u87042	v31672	I have eaten at countless sushi places around NYC, this place is amazing for not only price and quality, but quantity and attentive staff! I will defiantly be back.

u152611	v31822	Sabrina nailed it on the head, get the burger \
u26168	v31853	I think Starbucks policy with regard to ice water is, from a business perspective (not to mention a psychological one), pathetic.
u6318	v31853	If you are looking to camp out and get some work done, keep walking! They covered most if not all of the outlets!
u11527	v31853	The lines grow and shrink based on when the inter-city busses are picking up. There's not much you can do but come early and hope you catch a break. The upstairs is nice for waiting on a bus though.
u38431	v31853	Good for meetings if you don't need your laptop (all of the power outlets are covered). There's an upstairs area with more seating that's usually relatively empty.
u230805	v31853	Closed outletts. Stupid seating arrangement.

u5663	v31973	My favorite vegetarian dish is #16 Tsel Gyathuk Ngopa, which is sauteed noodles mixed with fresh green vegetables and tofu. Make sure you add the chili sauce that you get on the side.
u43293	v31973	Has to be one of the best deals in town. Get any of the soups for a hearty and heart-warming appetizer. Everything I've had is delicious!

u57736	v31973	Dumplings and spicy sauce...the best!!!

u11372	v32582	Love the bison cheesesteak wrap. Try the turkey meatloaf.
u1296	v32586	The fish and chips here must have come from some kind of prehistoric sea creature. It's huge. Way too big for one person to finish unless you are the Hulk.
u52312	v32586	Try the Welsh Rarebit - its the most heavenly open faced grilled cheese ever - also skip the apple berry crumble, too saucy
u184931	v32586	They will deep-fry anything you bring.  Anything.

u43854	v33743	The iced cap with choc shavings.... The Broc salad and the sizzling duck crepe- 4 uber yum rating

u2448	v34591	Best coffee in the hood. Great small bagels

u49805	v35260	Prosciutto sandwich is sinfully delicious.

u36865	v35833	Chocolate shake was good. Friend said the double is better than a single. Jerry Seinfeld ate here. And it's #13 on GQ's 20 burgers to eat before you die.
u71211	v35833	All you need is singles with cheese and onion. Steak and cheese takes up too much stomach space. Save all your room for sliders, you won't regret it.

u16498	v38693	Bird's Nest is delicious.
u52025	v38752	The best breakfast in the area, can't go wrong ;-)
u616	v38753	You can't go wrong with the sample platter, but go for the meat & potato dumplings too.  Maybe order an extra side of kielbasa.
u22575	v38753	Don't order the vegetable soup its just a potato in a cup
u29949	v38753	Best chicken noodle soup on the island. Overall better eats than gentrified veselka up the street.
u4463	v38775	Wow bad service and poor food. Stay away.
u17141	v38916	Great sandwich menu.
u40736	v38916	Amazing sandwiches with fresh Italian meats and homemade mozzarella for only $7!
u29123	v38920	Um, grilled cheese sandwiches should not be open-faced. Or have lettuce. Also, tuna melts should be melted. Also, boneless buffalo wings should have buffalo sauce on them.
u109481	v38920	If you order the French Dip, get extra jus... They give you a tiny cup of it.
u27367	v38929	Carbonara is made right.wud add more pepper,but not Alfredo sauce.egg,cheese,pasta water.fried mozz is 3 stix w sauce not the mozzarella in carrozza waiter said it wud be. (2 of 4 petals via Fondu)
u114319	v38932	Try the food some great options and recent additions like dulce de leche treats are great ! Cozy neighborhood coffee shop!
u82569	v39072	They brought Sausage (Christian Style), Vareniki with Sour Cherries, Vareniki with Potato, Baked Eggplant Saute \
u237070	v39104	I would skip this one - great atmosphere but very mediocre food. Not what you'd expect in Little Italy.
u38456	v39104	the pizza is so industrial. starting with the crust (which isnt crispy at all), continuing with the sauce (tastes like it was taken from a can at the grocery store) and finish with mediocre cheese.
u13999	v39120	Order via app or online to beat the long lunch lines and go straight to the register to pick up your order.
u25094	v39120	I love Chipotle. This one is as good as the others but pretty busy\/long lines with lots of tourists (no surprise given the location). (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

u21442	v39120	If you're getting food here, go for the Tacos or the Bowls. Their rice and beans are nothing special, so the best strategy is to load up on sour cream and meat.
u27404	v39120	This place is always too busy. You should be getting creative anyway and trying out the Koreatown digs on 32nd st. or at least nommy Heartland Brewery next door (with more time, of course.)
u59619	v39230	Ask for a punch card if u don't already have one! Great cafe latte.

u7599	v39230	Chai is... decent. Get the coffee, much better.
u43905	v39230	Good espresso, but not the most inviting or comfy venue. Best to take away, I think.

u34625	v39230	All their regular drip coffee is awesome
u13324	v39230	They manage do draw hearts in coffee but they don't have wifi and can't do a good hot chocolate
u25651	v39242	My god it's the perfect latte.
u1317	v39242	The attractive baristas and baristos (?) here keep the line moving & put a pep in your step with the super charged coffee. The latte designs = bonus.
u49206	v39242	take your coffee into the lounge! it's amazing.
u10760	v39242	Probably the best coffee in New York - keep on going back there. The hipster outfits are a bit of a turnoff tho - Portland one takes itself a little less seriously.
u82569	v39242	Winner of Best New Coffeehouse in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! Grab yourself one of their bottled iced coffees and plant yourself in the hotel lobby.

u1090	v39242	An opium den for hipster coffee addicts.

u199027	v39242	Wifi blows
u27404	v39242	This place always has a line for a reason: the people of Portland know what they're doing with their beans. Come at a slower time and enjoy your java in the Ace Hotel lobby with a good book.
u49206	v39242	get a coffee and relax.
u5009	v39242	They pull two shots for all sizes, so keep to the small latte unless you want to order extra shots in the medium or large!
u65514	v39242	Blueberry creame cookie. It is like eating cookie dough! Amazing
u78275	v39242	Charming staff and the cappuccino is a little drop of heaven, (emphasis on 'little', cup is mini size)!
u29177	v39242	the only coffee that wakes me up
u12194	v39242	Get a seat with an outlet and charge your phone\/laptop. There are outlets along the wall to the left - not only at the table in the middle. And yes, they do make the perfect latte.

u48071	v39253	Orange and carrots smoothie is the bomb!
u116122	v39261	A mostly new staff took over in Fall '10. Unlike the old staff, they're friendly and not jaded by the service industry. Get 'em while they're hot!
u116122	v39261	Mario makes the best double chocolate chip frappuccino if coffee isn't your thing.
u116122	v39261	There's a secret menu. Try the Oreo frappucino (white mocha syrup and regular mocha syrup in a regular double chocolate chip frap)
u116122	v39261	If Carly makes your double chocolate chip frap, ask for an extra pump of chocolate. She has a light hand when it comes to chocolate syrup.

u173878	v41522	The hangar salad is fantastic!

u29831	v42728	Good, but smac is better IMO
u8210	v42728	Better than Smac if you ask me. Mac Lobsta is bomb.

u46450	v42775	The Cadillac burger is indeed the Cadillac of burgers
u148837	v42775	Crab cakes are incredible. Alone, on the salad, on the sandwich - doesn't matter how you get them. Just get them.
u10675	v42775	Classic burger. No frills. Worth braving a few tourists and a less bro-heavy ambiance than 3rd ave. bartenders downstairs are fabulous.

u66089	v42775	Brussel Sprouts to die for!!   really...
u10675	v42775	I'm shocked at the number of bad tips here. This is false. Yes, it gets crowded and the service can get overwhelmed, but that's par for the course with any famous NYC jaunt. Come on a quiet night.
u27297	v42775	Amazing Apple Cobbler.
u13259	v42945	Yummy hot cocoa... get it with whip!
u139190	v43005	No outlets, slow service, $$ beer (even for an airport), ok food.  Prob best option for seated\/table service but that's not saying much.
u42214	v43005	Once you're past security in Concourse D this is the place to go. The beer is decently priced and the bar food is good. Try the chicken fingers.
u8051	v43052	Grab a spot by the window if you're lunching solo, and people watch along 8th street. Great location, staff is fast and cheerful.
u25094	v43052	Carnitas burro w pinto beans!
u63432	v43052	I love chipotle but this specific location is terrible. They're rude, inflexible, and food seemed old.
u13693	v43164	better coffee than the horton's next door
u67859	v43192	Also always ask to sit in the garden and snag one of the curtained cabanas--sooooo cozy in the winter and cool and relaxing in the summer--it's a great escape for lunch or dinner!
u50869	v43192	Curry chicken is slammin
u199027	v43192	Papaya is virtually calorie-free. Eat as much as you want - Asian proverb.

u72723	v43357	Bring a flashlight to read the menu at night
u174167	v43357	Ask for hummus when they seat you.  They used to serve it to everyone, but now they only do upon request.  It's free and yummy!

u122027	v43469	The worst service ever!! Please go any other at same street!
u69036	v43469	Food is hardly decent. Note to waiters: don't get mad if you get undertipped after billing gratuity on 5 ppl when you're providing minimal service ALONG with a nasty attitude.
u122027	v43469	Menu 10 euros pasta or pizza and drink... But pizza cold and too much cheese (bad quality) and poor ingredients. Sorry , novella is a bad election
u135368	v43480	Another 'tip' Two boots sucks!
u82569	v43579	Captain's Daughter: first and foremost a sardine sandwich. It uses an entire tin of the little fish, burying them underneath a pile of scallions, pickled eggs, capers, and the aforementioned herb
u44483	v43579	You can order any sandwich on the menu and you won't be disappointed
u181505	v43617	Chicken lollipop, blood sausage, and the curry are good!
u50489	v43617	If you really want an ethnic joint this place is perfect.  Himalayan live music paired with surprisingly tender yak.  Delicious! (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
u50869	v43795	Wish you had some couches or at least some comfy chairs or pillows or something
u231211	v43795	Get an iced coffee or hot latte. The pastries are from Balthazar and their croissants are like none other
u9171	v43795	They told me the put two shots of espresso in every cappuccino no matter what the size. If you need an extra kick, ask them to add a third. It's my standard there.

u8466	v43879	Beware, 9oz. is a lot of, um, meat.

u82569	v44078	The Village Voice voted this Best Brooklyn Tavern in our Best Of New York Poll!
u14964	v44078	Grab a seat at the bar so you can watch the mixologists working their magic. The drinks are spendy at $10 or $11 each, but you're paying for artistry -- things like muddled lemon and candied ginger.
u16602	v44078	Stop in for a Bloody Henry.
u50489	v44078	I love this place because it does not have the annoying pretense of a swanky cocktail lounge.  It is a solid place with great drinks.  Grab a drink here after a meal at\u2026 (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

u4787	v44217	You can't go wrong here. There is no bad choices IMHO. Definitely definitely definitely get dessert. You'll be sorry if you don't.
u27783	v44217	I know tom yum is to thai as wonton  is to chinese but damn, they make it well here! Nice variety of shrooms with bite and normally the shrimp is part of the soup stock. In this case, very flavorful!
u4787	v44217	The Jap Chae and Bul Go Gui are maybe the best I have ever had. Please don't tell my mother-in-law :-)

u221886	v53213	Worst service ever. Food took so long, wrong order, no refills plus bad attitude

u82569	v56596	Love the bar snacks, like sour sausage offered w\/ basil, mint, peanuts, and pickled veggies.
u23420	v56624	A perfect meal is the eggplant parm with linguini cooked with garlic and olive oil, and a glass of the house red.  It's relatively inexpensive too.  Great place to bring a date.
u207922	v56898	My Italian ex-lover Giuliano lives right by here. I miss him and our coffee runs so much! Maybe we'll cross paths here and rekindle that summer 2010 passion someday. *sigh*

u13902	v57404	Only one restroom.
u36245	v57674	thought this place was overpriced, plus they charged a $10 minimum for card use (one of my pet peeves, especially at an upscale cafe). devon & blakely down the street is much better value AND quality
u21380	v57674	be sure to try the cookies, hands down the best in the biz and also try one of their delicious crepe sanwich

u26729	v60031	No mention of the fish tacos???  Frigging awesome. And you are what you eat, which is why I'm awesome.
u68798	v60031	The mild guacamole is just that - good, but very mild. However, the Medium guac practically burned my mouth off! My advice: get the Mild with a side of jalepenos so you can adjust the spice yourself.
u63386	v60031	Cucumber margarita rocks! Yummy tacos! Finally a decent place on UES!
u216886	v60031	Right around the corner from my apartment - been here a few times for margaritas, beer, tacos & grilled corn. Nice atmosphere, food is good but a little pricy for what it is (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

u263441	v61118	Best bandeja campesina evvveeer try it

u2448	v61274	Cauliflower. Meatballs. Can't go wrong with any dish. And the service is excellent.
u4697	v61274	The bartenders are saucy, sassy and Southern.  This girl could not be more happy. Oh, it helps that that food and drinks are top notch as well. You can Spatzle me all day, boys.
u118709	v61285	5% off if u pay with cash

u25094	v65144	Good cozy italian on LaGuardia. Pizza is better than other dishes but all in all pretty, pretty good. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

u80104	v66081	The price is right, but the service is a bit passive-aggressive and it also pissed me off that they don't have a bread basket. Meatballs were phenominal.
u13880	v66081	Pasta here = #fail
u57992	v66081	Try the pannacotta with honey and rosemary. One of the best I've had in the city.
u89566	v66081	Paninos looked good. Meatballs were decent. No meatball shop meatballs, but pretty solid for brunch. Check in for a free Bellini! (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

u52962	v67064	Garlic steak is to die for. Mushroom risotto is amazing too!
u114319	v67064	We prefer this location to the midtown one-remember that neither dessert,coffee ,nor wine are included in pre-fixe price. And we eat lightly for the week before and after coming here !

u2720	v68216	@Ryan S. Thanks 4 the tip. I am now carefully avoiding any semen or suspected semen or semen-like substance in the Starbucks loo. Not an easy thing to verify. But I also noticed suspicious fluid too.

u38005	v68311	Seriously. Look out for Luis.

u39371	v68453	The dessert gelato wasn't any good. $8 for melted gelato, 4 strawberries and sugar isn't worth it. The rest of the food was great, sea scallops with crabmeat was delicious.
u56867	v68829	Awesome brunch spot and all you can drink champagne cocktails. Start off classy and leave a hot mess all before 2pm!
u24873	v68829	Try the cucumber happy hour cocktail...it's crisp, refreshing and OUT OF THIS WORLD.
u208636	v68829	Loved their south african wine from Seven Sisters, but they don't carry it anymore.  Too bad!  Food is excellent!
u48682	v68935	The employees are really sweet and friendly.
u953	v68935	Decent but lacks WiFi and character of other Thinks

u21881	v68935	Two bucks flat for a cup of Joe! In and out!
u43905	v68935	Coffee is great, bagels are good, grilled cheese is totally forgettable.
u27168	v68935	No wifi. Kind of a bummer.
u142669	v68935	Try the spanish latte. Mainly a haven for students, writers, and readers. If you want wifi go to the campus location or starbucks. Its not a problem for the rest of us.
u6	v68983	Nice vibe in here. They give too much pasta, though.

u4787	v69575	If you're not a regular here, don't expect any special treatment. It's so-so at best to begin with so I recommend avoiding it.
u4787	v69575	Have never had a great experience here. Service is not good I unless you are a regular...
u36206	v69601	Way overpriced snacks and drinks! Seems like the guy at the counter makes up prices as he goes. Also, they charge a EXTRA DOLLAR for any food made after 10pm.
u36661	v69745	Stay away from Anthony (tony), monteiro!
u60021	v69745	Whoever said appleee's is better than Tops is obviously nt from around here...

u253922	v69745	Try the mimosas.
u193062	v69953	They boast a $16 pastrami sandwich, just as the name of the place suggests, a pretentious price, cus although the sandwich is hefty, it's a lil dry and I've tasted tastier pastrami honestly.

u13128	v70790	Get the burrito, skip the reg plate (this is NOT Chipotle). the tortilla is fresh and has cheese. Get the super hot salsa if you like hot. It's no joke.
u16255	v70790	when asked what type of beans, say \
u82569	v70790	Winner of Best Burrito in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! Spring for the guac topping - it's the perfect addition to the perfect burrito.

u13693	v70790	From the clientele and the  food I feel like this is a secret portal to San Francisco.

u91387	v71070	Ask for the pecking duck early because it takes half an hour to make (it's not on the menu). Definitely worth it!!
u36704	v71070	Bad service, low class people, tons of bones in my duck wonton soup, adult couple at table next to me loudly making out. Yeah I won't be eating here again.

u121273	v71417	Excellent wine and beer (& cider) to accompany your meal.
u148828	v71486	Forget the fresh squeezed juices..Way too overpriced. Best deals are the fresh cut fruit bowls from the fridge by the door. They use fresh cut kiwi, mango, watermelon, papaya, pineapple and grapes!
u32206	v71579	Ask for the day's special!
u26060	v71641	This place is the best.

u90175	v71971	The spicy crunchy tuna is amazing!!
u44778	v71971	Amazing sushi - in both quality and presentation. I think of Loop as a more affordable and more intimate Koi. Reco the spicy tuna on crispy rice to start.
u38431	v71971	Great spot to have lunch on a nice day. Great soundtrack, friendly staff, and enjoyable atmosphere!
u170559	v71971	The 3rd Avenue roll is fabulous.

u8285	v72593	Try the Cheeseburger with Lettuce, Tomato & Mayo - Awesome! (via @Foodspotting)
u19408	v72623	Surprisingly good chicken on a block with a lot of good chicken. Much better than Big Arc chicken, and maybe not as great as BaoBQ, but that's apples and oranges.
u19408	v72623	Amazing, juicy and tender chicken, great place for take-out and way better than that Big Arc chicken next door. Such bitter competition. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
u86519	v72714	Sticking fingers in cups, outrageous lines, ghetto staff...this is by far the WORST Starbucks I have EVER been to...avoid if you can. You will thank me...
u17734	v72714	Welcome to the slowest Sbux in Manhattan!
u33575	v72945	black n white shake is the move!
u102	v73222	I like the food and drinks, but they play their music on some sort of odd, reverby EQ setting that is very distracting
u58	v73254	Did you order the bone marrow? If you didn't then you are simply doing it wrong. Flag down your server and correct your mistake.
u29831	v73254	The only place to consider eating late night.

u2228	v73304	Pick a sixpoint on draft, baby
u82569	v73405	The chicken pot pie sports a fluffy puff-pastry top, and rich, creamy chicken stew underneath. If you loved Swanson chicken pot pies when you were a kid you'll adore the luxuriance of this rendition.
u196154	v73405	I miss having a place like this in the neighborhood!  For all of you health nuts, pay a visit ASAP!
u180959	v73405	Found a hair in the dish and server was didn't care. Awful service.

u42214	v73888	Try the meatloaf sandwich!
u14448	v74191	It have doughnuts in the name but I like their egg and cheese sandwiches best.
u2374	v74294	There is absolutely NO justification for the prices they charge. Pizza isn't worth half. Go anywhere else. Seriously.
u166272	v74294	Calzone heaven Spinach and cheese at less then 350 calories YUM YUM YUM
u144261	v74407	Not impressed...
u224242	v74450	Very nice servers

u24772	v74896	Stick with the pizza and baked pastas.  Don't order the green salad, it's $11 for a few lettuce leaves and 1\/4 of a tomato.
u4356	v74896	Use the pepper oil (ask for it or it's already on the table) with your crust - delicious.
u27367	v74896	Try the Margherita - With egg & pancetta. Oozy yolk over everything. Fantastic. Like breakfast bacon & eggs with tomatoe sauce & toast(pizza dough)  (via @Foodspotting)
u27367	v74896	Try the House Gnocchi With Wild Boar Ragu - The boar was melt I yur mouth good. Gnocchi is almost never a bad thing.  (via @Foodspotting)

u13693	v75007	great spot to relax
u54561	v75022	The worst service ever. After waiting for my drink for 20 mins, I got a reply, \

u34386	v75029	The friendliest servers in the city
u197679	v75051	Franchise disguised as a local shop.  They're all the same.  Only a good place to eat if the weather is bad.  Pricey and rather greasy.
u33575	v75206	I have a bad feeling about this...
u47663	v75282	Very loud here I think due to the high ceilings. The sound just bounces around and echos. Don't come here to get any work done or bring noise cancelling headphones.
u26202	v75338	The don't take American Express, unfortunate.
u28925	v75371	Best frozen yogurt spot in NYC hands down. Pinkberry is so overrated.
u140970	v75371	At Phileo (formerly YogurtLand) you can choose from different flavored fro yo & add as many toppings as you want. Also they charge you by weight, not by size.

u429	v75701	Guinness honey mustard. Ask for it.

u96349	v75835	Coffeholic yayyy great place :)
u87874	v75835	It's true the line from 8:30-9a  can be long but they tend to overstaff then and are really good about getting everyone through fast.
u217167	v75955	Great variety of sandwiches! I got the Tuscan and it was great, huge hero.. I saved the other half for later and it was still good!!

u33575	v76581	Yummo Panko breadcrumbs under the crust!!!!
u8051	v76581	AVOID if possible. This pizza spot is overpriced and underwhelming, persisting by drunk patrons alone.
u25807	v76770	Longest line in the world filled with college students. Basically it's the daytime version of Williamsburg or the LES - just substitute alcohol for caffeine.
u29320	v76770	Not really that great if you don't have an NYU meal plan to spend, but it's so close to campus it's hard to turn down for convince sake.
u197679	v76770	Closed on Saturdays and Sundays in the summer.

u14842	v78005	Two.words. Crackling chicken.
u28925	v78067	Babaganoush is babababangin here. The owner was really nice too.

u9253	v78067	No coffee here :-(
u42214	v78081	Try the fettuccine with salmon. It's delicious. Their service is very friendly and amazingly fast.
u103216	v78081	Been searching for olive tapenade for a long time. Finally I found they serve it here with your bread in a tomato paste. A wonderful pairing up. Great with a dry white wine.

u54405	v79077	Try the vodka pie - amazing!
u28196	v79240	Best of the 3 locations in New York. Prepare yourself for large portions and lots of salsa music. The red sangria is a must, by the pitcher, it's sweeter that way ;)

u116122	v79862	Donuts are made on site and are often more fresh than at other Dunkin Donuts in the neighborhood.  The morning crew on the weekend is extremely friendly and will remember your order.
u116122	v79862	If you get the veggie flatbread, ask for it extra toasted - when they send it through the toaster just once it isn't quite enough.

u72170	v79919	Breakfast wraps are pretty tasty and filling and only $3.26 (incl. tax) right now. Thai Chicken Wrap & Ostrich burger are also satisfying. Smoothies = not worth the calories\/points.

u49206	v79919	Sit at one of the couches and you can steal the starbucks wifi. It's awesome.

u953	v80645	Unimpressed with the chicken-egg sandwich.

u49343	v80769	Steak sandwich - baguette was nice and fresh, steak was a little dry.  Fries were cold.
u34476	v80844	TERRIBLE FOOD. You might get lucky and get a hair in your pizza.
u183355	v80844	Keep walking! DON'T STOP. Eff this place. And check my tips - I'm never this upset to give negative review. Bunch of lazy ass, rude, crooks!

u47769	v80866	Not a place you want to go if you want authentic Filipino cuisine
u27682	v81096	Where are the burritos?
u82569	v81254	Anything with poached eggs is mind-blowingly delicious at this cafe!
u1509	v81254	Holy smokes the baked goods are nom-nom-nom delicious. Not to be missed.
u13880	v81254	Sit at the bar on the far left, watch the room. For breakfast I recommend the eggs in spicy tomato sauce. It will wake you right up.

u5183	v81254	The pork with crackling is in the top 3 \

u196154	v81254	The Roman Trattoria of the moment.  Danny Meyer never ceases to amaze with stellar food and the best service standard in New York City.  Peppered chicken on Arugula. So simple, so good.
u24873	v81254	Try the Americitriana - Amazing! Spicy eggs and tomato sauce (via @Foodspotting)
u175941	v81254	The maialino pork was very disappointing. It came with a side of hash browns. Yes, hash browns. Next.

u38701	v81284	The presentation of the oysters and sashimi sampler are unreal! Check them out.

u6741	v81357	The seafood soup. Seriously.
u68409	v81383	It's all about the 7 oz. burgers.  Get a classic combo or go crazy w\/ the toppings.  Waffle fries & shakes hit the spot too!  Open until 1:30 am on the weekends! - MichelleC.tv
u21380	v81579	OVERPRICED, last time i bought real food, made me sick
u82569	v81616	Try the classic bistro salad frisée aux lardons. Break the egg so that the lemon yellow yolk flows out, and mix it all together into a smoky, sticky mess. It's probably the best salad of the year.
u72	v81616	go really hungry and get the pork ribs (so salty!), fried cauliflower (whoa! i am a fan of cauliflower once again) and the corn (to balance the two sides). you'll probably take some of it home

u116296	v81766	this is it

u28925	v81990	Pad see ew with a Korean twist: Galbi and Mango Kimchi! What! So good!
u38456	v81990	Very bad service. At one point, the ENTIRE crew just sat to eat together!! We had to work hard to get their attention for some service, and when the waitress came, she treated us as we disturbed her.
u147510	v82051	atmosphere is off the hook!!
u47830	v82254	Egg white english muffin and tuna salad with a wheat bagel is good for gym rats looking to get a protein fix.

u178106	v82328	very generous quantity

u68370	v82441	Paul, the store manager, is awesome!

u17238	v82634	Best Indian in the neighborhood or the only one.
u257034	v82660	Finish everything or get yelled at (speaking from experience)

u20178	v83038	Don't expect the employees to talk to you. If I worked here I'd hate my life too.
u26197	v83182	Pepperoni and hot pepper pizza is the best!
u26197	v83182	The pepperoni and hot pepper combo is awesome!

u2621	v84910	They are changing their menu this week.  I hope the coconut crema is still around afterwards!
u5503	v84972	Split the fries. You won't finish them unless... You're a giant or dinasour

u133092	v95645	The best vegetarian item is the energy wrap, sans the turkey!
u132803	v95645	The goat cheese omelette is really good, as well as the spicy chicken wrap. They just renovated and it seems to be under new management. It's taking some getting used to. Like waitress service? Weird.
u11315	v95744	Really small restaurant. If you go there during the lunch rush, the food is delicious, but they're kinda anxious to move butts in and out of there as fast as they can.
u50246	v96499	Friendly staff but long lines. Free wifi is a nice perk but its slow.

u8051	v152402	It's OK to ask for more Parmesan cheese.  Drink the Sangria.
u72	v153035	for some reason, i always get the chicken and gyro combo platter. it's like breakfast, lunch and snacktime all in one and you cannot resist
u254822	v154789	Def go on live music nights and ask for John's section- he's the best!  Have the black eyed pea soup and save room for the bread pudding!
u29301	v155079	Daft punk goes surprisingly well with tacos and sangria. Definitely try the pomegranate skirt steak tacos!!
u193062	v155079	Got the mahi mahi tacos, pretty decent but pretty small, not truly worth the 10 bucks.
u102715	v155221	Weird... The service I got was pretty nice, and they served me with a smile. Can't understand from where the complaints come from...

u131875	v156396	It's heavy and juicy ! But still yummy
u14203	v156396	I recommend a cheeseburger with raw onions. You can skip the fries; they're nothing to write home about.
u150051	v156402	The tomato soup is really good, but I would only order a small, or it becomes too much. Getting your sandwich toasted might take an extra 10 minutes, but it's better that way.

u15247	v159042	One of the best tasting menus in NYC. Or, well, anywhere. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
u49766	v159042	s'mores are legendary!  Salt Cod fritters are also a must

u4787	v161178	Cuban Chinese food. Find a better place and I'll be there. Good food, good service, not cheap. Mixed drinks are surprisingly awesome.
u4787	v161178	Chicken. With. Cashew. Nuts. Ummmm, yes!

u4787	v166526	Nice beer. Nice food. Not expensive. Crowd is usually friendly. Bartenders are pretty cool.
u4787	v166526	Beer good. Food bad. Service worse. Maybe the worst Bloody Mary I've ever had. Told us halfway through brunch that the credit card machine was down. Won't be back. Go to Sanford's for brunch instead.

u154689	v168809	Try the Huevos rancheros - Best I've ever had. Perfectly crispy & spicy. (via @Foodspotting)

u71476	v170319	Shell steak is great if your afraid to try something -- grab a thai iced tea too

u30546	v170651	Sometimes you just gotta go double meat. too good.
u3021	v170700	Great place...inexpensive lunch

u48083	v170700	Still like food @ Room Service in Chelsea a bit better, but this place is damn good & gets a few more points for ambience over R.S.  Quality of food for price is hard to beat!
u24511	v170700	Get the Tom Yum soup. It is properly spicy. Get the Larb too, though it is NOT properly spicy. Thai iced tea is a ripoff in those skinnyass glasses.
u66456	v170700	Excellent pad thai! Can't wait to try other dishes
u22056	v170700	Very good cocktails, especially @ $6 during HH. Food incredibly inexpensive and I have to say, excellent value. Good portions for the money. Very cool space. Thai samosa a standout

u22365	v170835	best sandwiches and salads in chelsea....<3
u15760	v170936	Three Lentil Soup is a must if you come here. It's spicy, vegetarian and delicious! Ask to try it first.

u29301	v174401	Basically the perfect latte can be had here.
u38456	v175522	Lousy service and unfriendly staff. Double espresso was dull. Grilled cheese focaccia was decent.
u31304	v175522	Coffee is avg. but egg sandwiches are solid and they also have smoothies. Seating inside is nice and usually not crowded. Not a place with 20 phonies on macs.

u82569	v181971	Skip the more elaborate stuff at Okeanos, and stick to the simple, Greek dishes, foremost among them the whole grilled fish. The sardines are a great choice, but so is the pearly-fleshed striped bass.
