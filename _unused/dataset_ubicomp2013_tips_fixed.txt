1011372	2000360	The cupcakes taste like a stick of butter. Get the bread pudding or coconut cake with a cup of coffee.
1037391	2000360	Let's hit up Magnolia and mack on some cupcakes.
1016769	2000360	It's all about the banana pudding. Go ahead and get a large. Thank me later.
1000134	2000360	Eat here.  Diet at home.  Enough said.
1025094	2000362	Great steak and all the fixins. Lively atmosphere but seems a bit formulaic (as if it were a chain). (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1151828	2000362	If you don't mind the lousy service where the server is missing 99% of the night and don't mind waiting 30 mins to get your order taken then this is the place for you! :-)

1050489	2000390	Definitely was good enough to eat, but I am not sure it warrants the lengthy wait.  The tuna melt was certainly one of the best in New York and the hot apple cider is nice. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

1062734	2000423	JG Melon for nightcap with burger and jukebox
1068798	2000423	Best burgers on the Upper East Side. Whenever I go here, I always run into someone I know from prep school or who went to Buckley or Hewitt. Small world :)
1066541	2000423	Arguably the best hamburger in Upper East Side. Some would say in the city.
1015741	2000423	Awesome burgers and bar! Ask for Faisal at bar, he was a fantastic bartender.

1011372	2000446	Best lobster roll in NYC. Whole bronzini is the 2nd best dish. Sundae's are amazing too.
1022056	2000446	Sardine special was great. Lobster roll too. Deep fried oysters and clams were only OK. Sliders were fine, not overwhelmingly great, but not bad.
1062068	2000446	Lovely brunch gazpacho!
1107530	2000446	I'd vote for the fish taco's as well. The lobster roll is very good, but too mayonnaisey for my wife.  And the lobster knuckles are fun and tasty if you are skilled at removal.
1011372	2000446	HarryH is right, best lobster roll in the city but the star is the whole grilled daily fish. I prefer the bronzini!
1054073	2000446	MFC is a weekly staple. Grilled whole fish, fish tacos, cockles, lobster knuckles...all good!
1215619	2000446	lobster roll is good, for the price my vote is for luke's in e vill.. fish is worth your time & $$

1053109	2000452	Amazing brunch.  Delicious Latin American dishes and all you can drink Sangria.
1028196	2000452	Favorite Upper West Side Drunch Spot. Cheap & the sangria keeps flowing throughout the duration of your meal. The food and portions aren't the greatest but cocktails make up for it.
1175941	2000452	Try the earthy tasting Spanish Harlem sangria on a cold night. Yum!
1196154	2000452	definitely worth the trip uptown.  Awesome brunch!

1208163	2000476	Do not come here, low quality food and service. Had to send side of bacon back 2x's, once being raw, second time looking like it was a week old. Opt for ABC Kitchen, Craftbar or Almond.

1146210	2000482	Mr. Bourdain has nothing to do with this restaurant in eons. But still great.

1152611	2000507	Prices are steep, but its NYC so its average. Prime NY Strip Steak ($48) was excellent. Seems like I can only get good steak in NY.
1058063	2000507	And MAJOR waiter fail. No spoon for my friend having soup and no steak knife for me having steak.
1058063	2000507	The change in chefs is unfortunate and the service was the slowest ever. Another table left before getting food because it was taking so long.
1120838	2000512	Skip the avocado rolls- they're weird.  Get the huge margarita- they're awesome!
1060601	2000512	The margaritas are basic, but will do the job (and surprisingly I didn't have a hangover the next day). Plenty of vegan options and the food tastes fresh and un-heavy. YUMM!!

1029638	2000514	A little bit of a wait, so try to make a reservation. Burger was big but overpriced. Brunch looked phenomenal.

1028761	2000523	Best fish & chips...
1082569	2000523	Winner of Best Fish and Chips in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! Get the mushy peas as a side - far more delicious than the name would suggest.

1045808	2000543	Can't go wrong with brunch. Popular spot on Sundays!
1029594	2000543	This is my Monday night choice!  The sushi is good; esp when you consider that is is half price!  I like the mango choices.  Also, the Rolls Royce martini is a homerun one stop doozy.
1029594	2000543	I was so excited 2 get my free drink upon my 3rd visit that I dragged my pal here, only to have the server assume that I would not want the full service associated w\/ the Rolls Royce drink. How rude!

1072170	2000549	The seared tuna salad (a special) is really tasty and light.
1010932	2000549	Wow! A surprisingly delicious burger!
1014964	2000549	Bar Tabac has live music evenings Sunday-Thursday -- I guess on the weekends they want that extra bar space for paying customers.Typical music seems to be old-timey toe-tapping jazz, and I think it
1060601	2000549	I love love the goat cheese salad. This place is always fresh and delicious.
1002367	2000549	Try the mussels. Amazing!
1005009	2000549	Why is there a TV in here?

1107110	2000561	Great frozen margaritas!

1075708	2000571	So if you order a burger and don't get a beer on Monday, they charge you the full price. I don't drink. So I said no beer. Next time I'll just waste the beer. Clowns.

1211609	2000578	K: The Brewery had a great vibe! I felt like I was at a backyard party and everyone from the neighborhood was there. The beers were really stellar.
1010909	2000578	I'm the Osiris of this here, B.  If you're here for Happy Hours, take a tour.  The newly minted brewery expansion is very interesting, the fermenters are so shiny!
1214268	2000581	The boyz make a robust decaf soy capp fa sho. The AC is a plus on a hot Brooklyn morning. Sidewalk seating up front for people watching,  too.
1012194	2000581	The barristas are super nice. Locally roasted coffee beans are pretty good at $10\/bag.
1133658	2000585	Great Mexican food
1060284	2000585	Mole Poblano. Totally worth the wait.
1000334	2000585	Fish taco FTW!

1006886	2000602	Curry duck is a must.
1098138	2000602	Nothing like dining with huge b\/w photos of pretty ppl draped in noodles! Mini dumplings & grilled beef dish really good. My friends love the Pad Thai. Reasonably priced esp. for being on Union Square

1025094	2000603	How am I the first to review this awesome, atypical, tiny, Greek spot? Grilled eggplant is amazing as was the lamb sandwich. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1116062	2000603	The avgolemono soup is just delicious! Better than my ma's and grans.
1030502	2000603	A great place to meet celebrities,  cewebrites, or both, like Vin Vacanti.
1030502	2000603	The Greek salad is both delicious and authentic. The savory pies are good but there are better menu items.
1046413	2000608	The Wild Mushroom Sformato is a MUST -- it's like foie gras for vegetarians. Delicious!
1001002	2000608	try the bar, great place to eat if you have not planned ahead
1126441	2000609	Go to Lombardi's for the pepperoni, sausage and extra mozzarella pizza. So so good! And skip the breadsticks...
1172909	2000609	Do not order the breadsticks here, its a waste of money, its an inflated dry pizza crust, lacks butter and italian seasoning. Pizza Hut has better breadsticks!
1176532	2000609	Billed as the \

1014141	2000609	Try the Pepperoni Pie - Is it as good as Gremaldi's? The jury's still out. (via @Foodspotting)
1014964	2000609	P.S. If you have any room left after pizza, top it off with dessert at Rice to Riches across the street. It's like an ice cream parlor but with rice pudding. Really.
1014964	2000609	My favorite vegetarian pie: kalamata olives, sauteed spinach, fresh garlic. Extra sauce, cooked well done. My husband loves pepperoni but likes this pizza better.
1000953	2000614	Romantic cozy Russian place!
1054561	2000614	Amazing food, live entertainment. Great place!

1075708	2000618	Service here sucks. All \
1036721	2000618	The Hobo noodle is really good
1036721	2000618	They only accept American Express. So have cash or friends that will spot you.
1008466	2000618	Go downstairs after 7 but before 9 (that's when it gets crowded). Sit at the bar and listen to Ella Fitzgerald. You'll feel transported to another time.

1048197	2000630	Best seafood in NYC, hands down!
1196154	2000631	the chicken is good, still not sure whether its as good as the Yard Bird at Red Rooster!
1020706	2000631	Total yum, 2 full dinners can feed 4 bc each entree comes with 2 sides.
1001090	2000631	Get the Rev. Al Sharpton, fried. You won't regret it!
1135804	2000631	Usually a bit of a wait. Avoid Sunday's unless you like tourists and slow service. The food isn't the best soul food in the city.
1021380	2000631	Oh my god, the best friday I've had in a Long time, why? I did nothing, except go to the best soul food joint on 116th street. They don't deliver so order ahead and pick up or just go there order to g

1023420	2000639	Go to Joe Shanghai and order the Crab Soup Dumplings.
1000752	2000639	Their service has been a bit on a decline. Remember they already include the tip on your bill. So don't pay more if they are not doing it right.
1001499	2000639	One of my favorite places to eat in New York.
1196154	2000639	The closest thing to authentic soup dumplings in new york.  The crispy beef is also really good.
1024230	2000639	Quite a wait, but the soup dumplings are worth it! Want more than soup dumplings? Crispy whole yellow fish! Crispy jumbo prawns, another plus.
1014862	2000639	Ask for Melvin.  You'll have the food before you finish ordering.  Yikes.  :-)

1001319	2000649	I walked in and asked the bartender if they offered Christmas-style salsa dressing, and he didn't know what that meant. This place should not be allowed to use the name \
1068409	2000653	Fast service, plenty of hot tea, mostly oily grub & cash only.  Do yourself a favor & stick with the steamed buns. Those are \
1088145	2000653	Take some on the go.
1000616	2000654	If someone else is picking up the tab, look for the Pappy Van Winkle on the whiskey menu.
1016255	2000654	The $11.95 burger is amazing for lunch. Add cheese and bacon for $1 each.
1140970	2000654	You can't go wrong with the rib sampler!! Also try the mac & cheese!!
1038363	2000654	The Pulled Pork sandwich is awesome! And the cornbread is really good too.

1031247	2000654	One of my favorite spots. Mac and cheese WAY overrated though
1095346	2000654	I second the spicy cheese fries - there's just something about pigging out from a bucket that adds to the allure! My friend was pleased with the huge gluten-free menu that's mostly unadvertised.
1036758	2000654	Either go for any of the ribs, or try the Rhapsody In Cue. And after the dinner head downstairs for some live Jazz.
1046145	2000654	Ask for the fry bread with toffee instead of chipotle butter. and get it for dessert!
1043127	2000654	The brisket sandwich is the best in NYC. Get it. Love it. Thank me later.

1082569	2000717	Get the eggplant parm-Seeds ooze out the sides, tomato sauce laps at the edges, cheese gums up the works, and the eggplant itself has dissolved into something unidentifiable deep in the sandwich. Mmm.
1001627	2000718	Get the peekeye crab salad. Awesome.
1059619	2000718	Ask for the price before you order the specials- they were almost $10 more than other entrees (and not worth it)

1082569	2000721	Invariably, the oysters will be ice-cold and perfectly shucked, plunked down without ceremony -- a throwback to when oysters were an everyman food. All they need is a squirt of lemon

1060211	2000751	Amazing - went for Big Eye Tuna Tarts, Red Snapper Tacos, Tuna Crispy Rice,  Crispy Lobster Wonton, Spicy Crispy Shrimp, Chilean Sea Bass Skewers
1058686	2000751	the lobster tempura is a must!
1040266	2000751	Alright food actually but don't expect any attention from the staff. Not even standing up waving the menu seemed to help.
1009769	2000751	Do not miss the Spicy Crispy Shrimp or the Big Eye Tuna Tarts. My favorite is the Tuna Crispy Rice. Make sure to sit at the sushi bar at least once.
1000104	2000753	The best rustic Italian food we've had in NYC. The octopus and baccala appetizers are winners and the beef tagliata entree slayed. Also, great atmosphere and super friendly service.
1022683	2000753	Let them just bring out the goodness! They know what they are doing.
1018406	2000756	Open Bar with live band playing Cuban Music, 8PM every Thursday  ;)

1226771	2000764	Tasting menu with wine pairing was perfect. Amazing desserts!!! Lychee sorbet, wheat germ ice cream, and chocolate soufflé drools.
1021442	2000769	if you are a college student in the area, it's a PERFECT place to go before getting dropped off by parents. Otherwise, make sure to go there during Brooklyn Restaurant Week for a massive feast for $25
1111582	2000769	what a lovely cheesecake! see ya next vacation :*
1202494	2000769	I can't get over the rat that was seen on top of the cheesecakes a couple years ago. Google it please. If that's what their secret crack ingredient is count me out! no matter how good they are.
1006411	2000769	Try the matzo ball soup: _perfect_ from the chicken soup to the matzoh ball
1006411	2000769	Try the Cheesecake - #yummy  (via @Foodspotting)
1012533	2000769	Like Juniors and its classic neon signs? Check out photographer Yale Gurney's rendition of it blown up large on Gurney's signature canvas (giclee) @ yalegurney.com\/shop
1026168	2000769	Pricey but a BK must. GIFT IDEA--ship a cheesecake (in that amazing striped box) to a friend.
1002720	2000769	Epic breakfast!
1009040	2000770	Go to Florio's to enjoy great sigars, inside. You'll probably feel like you're in a soprano's episode. You might run into John Perry Barlow.
1205455	2000771	Not as good as Chinatown, but not bad for this neck of the woods.  You can order off menu.
1050489	2000772	Classic, unforgettable, and fantastic.  This is one of the top places on the bucket list along with the pyramids of Giza.  The fried chicken is a nice surprise as is the\u2026 (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1013618	2000772	With all the mobster photos lining the walls, there\u2019s no hiding the mafia connection behind this East Harlem institution - I'd buy some of their pasta sauces on the way out, you filthy animal!
1024873	2000773	Try the Spicy Bloody Mary - And the adult drinks are good too... ~Uncle Deno and Greg (via @Foodspotting)
1078275	2000773	Great fare, cocktails and ambiance but beware the aggressive vultures that like to swarm, then attack. Pretending to speak another language usually helps.
1008388	2000773	Nice stop after walking\/studying in the NYC Public Library. Beautiful 4-season view of Bryant park in summer and ice skating in winter
1262073	2000773	The bartender who wears all the different ties is GREAT!!!!
1024873	2000773	Try the Shirley Temple - \
1082569	2000774	Their Jambalaya with chicken and andouille sausage, Blackened Shrimp, and BBQ Pulled Pork were featured dishes at Choice Eats
1033560	2000774	they have the worst website ever. seriously ive seen better Prodigy homepages.
1033560	2000774	Great beer selection
1052713	2000774	Even if it is not on the menu, ask for the Gator Burger...  We eat here every time we're in NYC.  This place is the best you'll get outside NO!  Who Dat?
1027367	2000774	Good selection of bourbons in almost every price point. Went early & bartender was nice & chatty.when slammed doubt he can do that but it was nice & makes me wanna go back (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1052713	2000774	The Jambalaya is really good too and their Hurricanes are authentic.
1057981	2000774	try their brunch
1257034	2000781	Really yummy coconut mojitos.  Try the skirt steak or the chicken and shrimp with tostones
1077887	2000781	Love the cuban food and fun atmosphere
1007487	2000781	The Churrasco is amazing. Finish it off with the Pastelillos de guava and queso blanco and you're set.
1089566	2000784	So many good tapas to choose from. Didn't even get to the paella. Bacon wrapped shrimp was underwhelming but the croquetas were bomb. Check in on foursquare for free sangria. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1012736	2000784	Paella is delicious, as well as the sangria!!!
1050489	2000787	This is where Andrew Carmellini got his start.  The food is still sublime although it is a little on the fancy side. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1121273	2000787	Still the best. Nice room make-over. Great service. All the flavor of Daniel's without the fussy pomp!
1006243	2000788	Bring a few friends and order the entire menu.  This is my favorite restaurant in NY.  I hate to go a week without eating here.
1017574	2000788	Vegetarians should steer clear of this place. Great service and rad place but unless you want a salad or omlette head elsewhere.
1047859	2000788	Split several appetizers\/first courses among your group. Then order the biggest steak on the menu. Dip the heavenly fries in the other-worldly marrow butter that comes with the steaks.
1001826	2000788	Glad they finally got rid of the paper straws for their bloody mary.
1034281	2000788	Large bloody Mary. Then any of the food, cause its all amazing!
1064130	2000792	salads are for sharing. love the venetian cocktail. it's a mistake not to order mushrooms.  scallops are unreal, and the gritty texture you taste isn't sand; it's salt.
1196154	2000792	The hen of the woods mushrooms:  intense flavor.  Striped Bass:  perfectly cooked.  The beet salad was also noteworthy.  For dessert, try the tangerine buttermilk sorbet. Delish!
1012310	2000792	Excited about the dinner here, let's see if Tom Colicchio hasn't lost his touch ;)
1242828	2000792	Definitely order the sweetbreads and the rose wine.
1008988	2000792	Checking it out next Friday--heard many good things.
1037946	2000801	Get the Cactus Pear Margarita- or any Margarita for that matter, as 'tis their speciality!
1193062	2000801	Out of everything, the margaritas and the appetizers stole the show.
1079352	2000801	always double up on the queso fundido.
1098138	2000801	Went for Bday Party & because we're fans of Bobby Flay. Got the Pork Tenderloin. Although delicious, it was the sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter that was out of this world.
1073961	2000801	Def get the goat cheese and blue tortilla for an app.
1024873	2000801	Try the Chocolate Cake - Dessert nom nom nom. (via @Foodspotting)
1024873	2000801	Try the Poblano Chile Relleno - Main course (via @Foodspotting)
1024873	2000801	Try the Shrimp cake - First course (via @Foodspotting)
1119448	2000801	Way too expensive for the tastes\/portion. Dinners had weak flavors. Salmon tartar was pretty good. Pic is chile relleno
1211609	2000801	We got into Bobby Flay completely by accident. We didn\u2019t really watch the shows until after we ate at Mesa Grill, first found by checking out Restaurant Week.
1013530	2000804	Truly the best waitstaff in NYC
1013530	2000804	The grilled veggie platter is one of the best dishes I've ever had.

1082569	2000807	Get katsudon w\/ miso soup-a nicely fried pork cutlet cut in strips, mired in an oniony egg omelet w\/ a salty tang, & deposited on a big bowl of white rice. Satisfying meal, & you'll be out in 15 mins
1163156	2000807	Miso broth is way too salty leaving my ramen experience quite disappointing... Stick to the veg dumpling soup or watch out for the salty miso - didnt enjoy that!
1163156	2000807	Green tea mousse and sweet potato pudding ... The veggie dumpling soup is great and very filling for $6!
1210809	2000807	The Tori (chicken) nanban-don is pretty good.
1037873	2000808	hate to say bad stuff about any spot. It's pretty expensive for pretty \

1027367	2000812	Haven't tried em all but the BLT is top notch. When they say \
1041694	2000812	Only good Chicken Fried Steak I've found in the city.
1027367	2000812	I've sampled a lot to be fair & cause I was hungry, but they may have the best BLT in the city. At least below 23rd cause that's where most of my testing was done. Knickerbocker is a closetie

1000104	2000837	Get the Mud Mocha. It's a regular coffee with just a squizzle of chocolate, making it a nice alternative to coffee though not too sweet.
1007599	2000837	Chai latte rocks.
1231094	2000840	Birthday cakes yes!!!! Cupcakes not so much...
1122027	2000840	good american spot between so many turistic places around the area! And order hot chokolate!! Beautiful
1000616	2000841	They split their menu into full plates and half plates, so you can order a little of everything.  Go for the escargot, mussels and filet (cause they got no bearnaise sauce for that strip steak!)
1154106	2000841	Get the Steak Tartare!
1154106	2000841	Casimir is now offering half portions of the Entrees.

1008663	2000841	Monkfish is excellent
1004663	2000841	Don't come here. Horrible service, bland food, never got a single refill on my coffee. Cute decor is all it has going for it.
1044236	2000845	Get a little of everything. There are some mini versions of classics. Don't forget to see the bins of cookies behind the counter.
1025787	2000845	thumbs up for the cheesecake & ? the individual-size
1010565	2000845	One of the best places in the City is beneath the exhaust vent of @veniero's Bakery.
1046450	2000845	Don't be an idiot get a Cannoli
1021380	2000845	I was on a mission for cookies, they had none, just shortbread cookies, and they DONT COUNT
1030484	2000845	Absolutely the best dessert place in the East Village. I recommend one of the many varieties of chocolate cheesecakes.
1080718	2000845	The mini-cannolis and rainbow cookies are AWESOME!
1054561	2000851	Not the greatest steak, nor sea bass, the wine is too pricy. This remains a wonderful brunch place though.
1031577	2000859	Loved the sweet soy steak with the lo-mein noodles. Was craving asian and steak and this hit the spot

1024436	2000908	whitefish salad on a freshly made bagel. the long line is worth it, but move quickly, know your order, and never *ever* ask to have your bagel toasted (they're freshly made on premises!)
1036245	2000908	Awesome bagels and cream cheese, plus they serve La Colombe coffee. Perfect combo.

1029831	2000920	A standout sit-down among a jungle of Italian restaurants.
1048217	2000920	Best pizza in NYC; it's a coal oven. House wine is great. Garlic cheesy bread is a must. Live jazz nightly. Leave a note on the chalkboard in the bathroom.
1033560	2000920	Only one restroom. Line always super super super long. 10-15 min wait. Have fun.
1005254	2000925	THE New York deli experience.
1012382	2000925	Their matzoh ball or mushroom barley soup is always unreal. my favorite is their triple Decker sandwich #3, substitute the salami with pastrami. Amazing!!

1022953	2000928	The original NYC Steak House located over the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn.  The steaks are amazing, ordered based on number of people not the cut of steak.  Also, try the tomato & onion salad!
1036758	2000928	Make your reservation three weeks in advance, the waiting list is ridiculous. Start with the jumbo shrimps then go for the steak. Service is hit or miss.

1006318	2000933	Good food.  Service is shoddy.  If you get the older gentelman at the front, you better have your entire party with you.  One person short on a 3 person reservation and we are stuck waiting.
1013999	2000938	You must get the strangled priests.
1120838	2000938	Ask for cappuccino and they write a message to you!

1018406	2001271	They do have WiFi but they won't share with customers...
1043905	2001271	There really should be a sign when you walk in telling you what to do - 2 separate dining spaces, no waiters visible, and a counter. A tad confusing... But it's a nice feeling space
1129428	2001271	Try the smorgasbord (via @Foodspotting)
1014249	2001282	Great place to grab a beer with friends
1033560	2001282	Sit at the bar.
1211609	2001282	A New York classic.  Stone Street itself is a time warp to the turn of the century. Blink and you might miss it.
1052970	2001282	Great service except dessert took forever to come. Dinner, appetizers, and drinks came really quickly. But over half an hour for some apple pie and some ice cream, really?
1049774	2001283	Great food and vibe. Disappointing cappuccino
1008550	2001284	Pulled pork sandwich. Don't spoil it by adding or removing anything. It's awesome!
1013904	2001284	$2 margarita's on Wednesdays!!!! and everyday: Swamp Water :D YUMMERS!!!!
1004787	2001284	People, do yourselves a service and go get some real BBQ - not here. Really. I think Jimmy is from Long Island.
1064748	2001284	Drew is the greatest ever!!!
1045573	2001284	All you can eat and drink (ribs and draft beer) for $23.  So good.  2 hour time limit.  Bit of a downer, but adds a bit of excitement, right?  Well worth the money.  Great ribs.
1010932	2001284	Wf pw brotherjimmys
1050152	2001284	$.35 wings on Saturdays. Chipotle rocked
1013904	2001284	wednesday!! $2 margaritas for the girls!! everyday: Swamp Water & Hot Wings <3 YUMMERS!!!
1105588	2001285	Order the Milos Special and the Tomato Salad!
1116062	2001285	Though everything is delectable, you must order fish. A whole fish grilled. I heard they grill it first and then put it in the oven. The meat of the fish is super fresh, super tasty.
1015137	2001289	Try the chicken stays! It's awesome!
1000072	2001292	can this turn into my small tea place on the west side (i haven't found a replacement since wild lily closed at the end of 2006!)
1063524	2001292	hands down the tiniest bathroom (sorry- loo) in all of nyc!
1013095	2001292	Sticky Toffee is FANTASTIC. Same goes for the ginger custard

1034355	2001305	Everything on the brunch menu rocks! Especially  the crunchy French Toast! Homefries are awesome too!
1061338	2001305	THE brunch spot.  Try the velvet pancakes but ask for extra icing and strawberries.  Also the gravy for the biscuits is bomb.
1000072	2001307	get the saltimbocca (translation: \
1023524	2001307	can't say enough great things about Lupa, food is consistently awesome, service is amazing and u'll get a great meal whether seated at table or at the bar. proscuitto, cacio y pepe, tartufo..
1196154	2001307	the pastas here are such a great value for the money, as long as you don't mind waiting!
1004167	2001307	The staff will do whatever they can to interrupt you. Its crazy.
1077298	2001307	so relaxed. amazing bold italian flavors. just the way i like it.
1023420	2001307	I love sitting at bar and talking to Jen (also occasional waitress).  She's bright, gracious and knowledgable about the food and wine.
1082569	2001316	This Choice Eats attendee brought Spring Chowder: cucumber-scented chowder with mussels, clams, and shrimp finished with an herb pistou. It was a big hit!
1017454	2001316	not sure what happened.  Loved this place but the changed the food.  Please fix it!
1136058	2001316	Delicious burgers and DuMac & Cheese. Be sure to order the burger medium rare to avoid overcooking.
1032518	2001316	The lilac garden cocktail is amazing.
1009962	2001326	Mosquitos bad headbanger music nuff said. Som good slices tho.

1040518	2001327	Cocktails infused w\/frozen orchid flowers, a must-try!
1196154	2001327	Few restaurants can fill the dining room during an economic downturn.  Daniel has firmly positioned itself as a gastronomic institution worldwide. The white Alba truffle tasting took my breath away.
1196154	2001327	Consistently one of the best restaurants in New York.  When truffles are in season, order the truffle tasting.  Its magnificent.
1002501	2001329	Great Bloody Mary.
1025094	2001329	Really good food and great service. Great for breakfast, brunch and lunch. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1058686	2001329	You HAVE to try the eggs benedict with apples on french toast..make sure you ask for bacon so the sweetness evens out..it sounds weird but its seriously amazing!
1038407	2001329	Gazpacho is insane!!
1019729	2001329	Short Rib Salad is the best... perfect.
1015416	2001329	Power lunch. No power suit required.
1000953	2001345	Fantastic burgers, yummy pancakes n sausage
1023420	2001345	A favorite of mine are the Belgium waffles, side of corn beef hash and coffee.
1195601	2001345	Best French Onion Soup... Order your own you won't want to share!
1079452	2001345	Cory from disney channel was just here :)
1013259	2001347	The blueberry banana bran muffin is a win for muffins everywhere!  Delish!
1049812	2001347	Chicken meatball soup, chocolate chip cookie and raspberry iced tea. My favorites

1082819	2001348	Ask as ap. the edamame. And dip it on the shoyo. And let it swimming the for a loong time. :)
1082819	2001348	The temaki here is good, but is verry small.
1038456	2001354	Wow!! What a great place... Food is high quality (pizza and pasta) abd service is welcoming.
1080104	2001354	Solid margherita pizza - worth returning for if in the vicinity. Salads are completely forgettable.
1062189	2001360	Pasta is bland and horrible. It's not even al dente. Do not get. Although the sausage was grilled to perfection but wasn't good enough to save the dish.
1029831	2001360	Enjoy the old-man atmosphere with a brew and quiet conversation.
1023442	2001360	best french toast. ever.
1022056	2001360	Burger is amazing. Avoid the catfish. Clam chowder was great too.
1017982	2001360	Sit at the bar.
1023442	2001360	roasted chicken club and a glass of wine. and the waitress was extremely nice
1017023	2001360	Best bar in soho, hands down.   I'll let you know how the veggie burger is.
1022658	2001372	Dessert is better than the pizza - head to BK for the real stuff
1025094	2001376	Love this place. Small, brightly lit upstairs and very large, cool but dark downstairs. Need reservations. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1048043	2001376	The Mercer Burger has to be tasted ! AMAZING !
1027304	2001376	The chicken sandwich w\/ avocado is amazing! Try the shrimp salad as well
1211609	2001378	A great steak and an even better Baked Alaska. It\u2019s awesome to sit in the restaurant and the think about all the famous people who used to frequent the dining room.
1215619	2001379	desipte all the hype a tasty place! try the elvis.. everything tastes better with bacon. everything.
1014912	2001379	This place is heaven for peanut butter lovers! You might want to skip the peanut butter BLT...there's not enough bacon to keep it from getting drowned out by the peanut butter.
1023999	2001379	Get the Elvis with bacon so you don't live your life wondering \
1029831	2001379	But yourself a jar of smooth operator and bring the goodness home with you!
1050730	2001379	Death by Peanut Butter = yum.
1125665	2001393	The cheese burger pizza is to kill for. But the traditional slice is perfecto
1059479	2001393	Cheeseburger Pizza plus Siracha. Hangover solved.
1211167	2001393	What used to be my favorite pizza place on NYC is now serves mostly over priced day-old slices which they overcook so you won't notice how long they've been sitting out. Order a fresh pizza instead
1082569	2001394	Cowgirl's chicken fried steak is exemplary in every way-it's something of a culinary miracle. Underneath is a mound of mashed potatoes, which is the proper accompaniment
1033575	2001394	Order the baked potato for DESSERT! #win
1231094	2001394	Food sucks, place is DIRTY!!!!
1055222	2001394	That's a spicy bloody mary!
1005183	2001394	Note to self $2.00 PBR all day at the bar!!
1027297	2001394	Pulled pork sandwich is perfectly tangy while the strawberry lemonade is wonderfully subtle. Great brunch spot.
1000072	2001395	as you know, grimaldis has a no slices policy. I dare you to order up and eat an entire pie by yourself. (you choice of toppings)
1063432	2001395	HORRIBLE service. Pizza tastd great BUT it was cold. No one told us it was ready. Then they took forever finding salt. Get takeout, ask for it hot, get a drink from the nearby coke machine and go to b
1014141	2001395	Try the Pepperoni Pie - Freshest mozerella. (via @Foodspotting)
1167182	2001395	Best Pizza EVER!!!! Great locale as well.
1053581	2001395	The experience is worth the wait!
1038897	2001395	Located right under the Brooklyn Bridge! Worth the queue! Probably the best pizza in NYC!
1184552	2001395	SO worth the wait!
1243901	2001395	Have to wait long time but worth it !
1022658	2001395	call ahead for take out (eat on the new pier park) and get it pepperoni - they curl up and tase better than bacon
1013999	2001395	Order on the phone and pick it up to skip the line.
1064130	2001398	app: tortilla crusted shrimp; entree: southern fried chicken; dessert: mud pie
1000542	2001404	diddo on the spicy rizzak, but keep the turkey and switch out the bacon dr turkey bacon
1018799	2001404	Spicy Rizzak is a must but the wait is annoying
1055222	2001404	Unlike you fatties, I found my sandwich to be perfectly sized. Not to mention, delicious.
1105100	2001407	This restaurant is participating  in Chinatown Restaurant Week Mar 9 -18. Have a look at the $18.88 pp menu.
1015830	2001407	Come before 3pm!

1196154	2001407	the only place I go for dim sum!  An unforgetable experience!
1017435	2001407	still the best joint in chinatown for dim sum. also very gwei lo friendly.

1242412	2001410	Pizza is Awesome... After Clubbing. Check it out!
1071605	2001410	Good place to go on the weekends. Sometimes a line. Coat check downstairs is clutch.
1000556	2001411	Food was pretty good but my lasagna was cold in the middle and service was a bit too rushed, had to order a few things a few times :)
1002448	2001411	Words can not express. The specials are always amazing. The taglietelle, the montauk bass, and it's cheeeeap
1141794	2001412	Try the Espresso Brownie - With #caramel #icecream (via @Foodspotting)
1173021	2001412	Nice bar area - esp if you are dining solo. Service was a bit slow but the bar menu is perfect for sharing with a group.
1066858	2001415	Quick service, but you have to know what you're ordering. I hear the duck & lobster are the best options.
1088434	2001415	Try the Spicy Beef Chow fun, Two Lobster Special, or any fried rice combination with fried egg #awesome
1045573	2001415	Absolutely the best roast pork you will find in New York.  My Go-To is the roast pork and soy sauce chicken over rice.  Get extra ginger!  Trust me, because, well, you know...

1025627	2001428	This has the cheapest drinks and best food in NYC
1015495	2001428	Don't go on a Tuesday. There's a busker standing by the jukebox who'll sing City of New Orleans and You're So Vain. Without irony.
1093095	2001428	Best burgers around ... :-)
1015416	2001430	breathtaking experience from start to finish. highly recommend the yellowfin tartare, crispy duck, and brooklyn bridge for dessert
1182628	2001430	Love this place
1226771	2001430	Apple crumb foie gras, lobster, and sea scallops were amazing! Finish off with Brooklyn Bridge dessert.
1040642	2001430	One of the most beautiful views I've ever seen from a restaurant. Even on a rainy day. The crispy duck breast is delicious. New York Cut Sirloin is pretty good.
1020095	2001430	No hats allowed
1003744	2001441	Food is great but the bartenders better.

1000953	2001448	Lo mein noodles with shrimp, ftw.

1054251	2001469	Really, they have lots more than pizza

1038491	2001473	Peppered goat cheese pasta is amazing at 3am and heated up the next day for hungover leftovers
1000836	2001473	Ignore the terrible renovation (it now looks like a cheap sushi place even though they don't serve Asian food) and eat some delicious sammiches and fries.
1005663	2001473	Fresh herb omelet is the way to go!
1000953	2001473	Excellent value dinners and house wine.
1000953	2001473	Pancakes sausage fruit brunch awesome
1086698	2001476	Have the Pork Chops with Hot vinegar peppers.  Out of this world if you can take the heat.
1065107	2001477	finish your broth.
1034575	2001481	Got a LivingSocial coupon that would take care of $50 worth of food. Unfortunately, the food was so good & filling that we only satisfied $39 worth. So worth it! P.S. try the bacon wrapped dates.
1016602	2001481	Bacon wrapped dates. That's all you need to know.

1168434	2001486	get food poisoning from the turkey burger
1040661	2001490	Best Dim Sum. Always fresh!
1043905	2001490	More like Dim Sum SLOW SLOW, actually.
1043905	2001490	Beware the shared table - more paperwork involved than a tax return.
1025121	2001490	The shrimp noodle is the BEST. You will walk out a changed, more centered person if you order it.
1000072	2001492	the century club: since the 1870s. a lunch and after-work spot when i used to work at sony
1008466	2001492	Their burger is small, thin and delicious.

1260356	2001492	Yeah, the burger, but their Lobster roll with an order of french fries is the business!  Only on Wednesdays though.  Lobster Mac-n-Cheese, another good item.  Only on Fridays.

1032791	2001494	Great hangout place. Get a beer, not a mixed drink. I prefer Guinness.
1021389	2001494	service STILL sucks. food still very edible.
1022658	2001494	Not Steve's but damn good key lime pie from Bay Ridge - wait and let it thaw a bit - tough it out...

1002036	2001498	Shrimp Ticul: not for beginners, very hot, but SO good!
1002260	2001498	Mojito's rock. As does the shrimp chipotle and the Cuban burrito. Happy to go tio a rowdy fun, restaurant
1094175	2001498	It's true: Tried the shrimp Ticul and it put my mouth on fire even after asking for it to be bumped down one notch on the spicy scale. If you like spicy, you'll LOVE it
1021652	2001501	Get the duck magret but ask them to leave out the rosemary
1008388	2001508	Branzino, bombolini,  everything is fabulous

1058774	2001602	Goulash night has gone up to $7 but there are some new menu options!
1000429	2001639	It's a long wait, but they'll take your number and give you a call when your table is ready. It doesn't matter what you order as long as you make sure to have a biscuit on the side.

1238993	2002540	I am the only white person here. And the bathroom stalls are see through
1000072	2002541	not on the menu: ask for the cotton candy. usually a table with kids gets it--and then the whole place wants it
1015416	2002541	Tribeca is my favorite location. Reasonably priced wine and delicious food. Check out the ground floor bar or, if you're with a large group, the large, circular booth upstairs.
1027292	2002541	Seriously. It's like when you have an empty cupboard of food and experiment with what's left... Highly disappointing!
1023264	2002561	The best pizza you can possibly eat in New York City. Others will scream about Grimaldi's or some other place, the is no better pizza than Di Fara. Take the Q train to Ave J, you will never regret it

1062536	2002623	Hum Rum is Spice Market in a bottle
1211609	2002623	Whiskey Passion Fizz! Get one , maybe even three! We only had drinks here and already want to go back for more. Can't wait to eat here! Loved everything about it the look , the vibe, and even the smel

1029383	2003246	Food OK, but the 20% service charge is not reflected in any of the service they provide, like the $30 dlls house wine, warm bread served only once, or just 2 waitersfor the whole restaurant. Don't go.
1015137	2003246	Slow service, average minus food. Not coming back here

1249523	2003293	Family Style dishes...so don't over order! . Make sure one person is delegated to order for the group its less confusing! They accommodate large groups of 15 or more! Great service!!!
1075042	2003294	The service is not good,  the place needs a food makeover asap.....horrible food presentation...disappointed.
1055428	2003294	Don't be fooled by it's location or it's look, it truly is nothing more than a pricey late night diner with a nice view.
1082569	2003297	There's something for everyone at Morell Wine Bar -- they have over 2,000 wines available to choose from!
1082569	2003297	Winner of Best Wine List in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! Ask your server for pairing suggestion from their selection of small plates.

1006267	2003372	razor clams.  yummm
1196154	2003372	I love this quaint tapas bar, and the menu is authentic.  The brandada is delicious, the clams are also excellent.  Always crowded and they don't take reservations.
1008952	2003372	Love the calamari po-boy sandwich. So tender
1195669	2003412	Love this place -- GREAT food \/ ambiance and very very affordable. Though, it gets very loud \/ crowded on the weekends after 9pm, so I'd go early if you want to chat without losing your voice!
1052312	2003412	nowhere else can you eat this cheap and this good - the Kang Gai is heaven.
1054488	2003412	Fried Calamai is great!! Well seasoned and great with plum sauce!
1064130	2003412	excellent thai - loved the nuur kraprow, kang panang gai, and spicy noodles (they aren't that spicy). cash only.
1054488	2003412	Calamari is GREAT with Plum sauce
1067735	2003412	The best Thai restaurant i've been to. Not to mention that it was extremely cheap, but they gave you more than enough food. For a total of Chicken with garlic sauce, shrimp with sweet and sour sauce,
1006083	2003421	Great brunch!!
1016602	2003421	Ask to sit on the rooftop and grab a drink (or two) downstairs at B61 while you wait.
1020537	2003421	Wow. Beautiful view, great service, delicious food. Loved the tamales & Huevos Oaxaca. They're also really accommodating with large groups!
1020537	2003421	Try the Huevos Oaxaca - Fried eggs over spicy beans and crispy tortillas, jalepeno potatoes and fried plantains :) (via @Foodspotting)
1034460	2003423	This place is BYOB. So i think the food is good here and worth the money, but keep in mind that this place is BYOB. And I am writing this review while i'm still here. BYOB. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1026055	2003423	My friend calls this food \
1026055	2003423	Honestly, this place sucks. If you like Indian food you won't recognize what you're served here.
1052284	2003423	The butter chicken is amazing here. Make sure to go to the downstairs restaurant
1098138	2003423	I wonder what the utility bill looks like for all those lights. You want to go to the restaurant on the top right. There appears to be 3 others that look the same. We got to celebrate a bday! Oh man.
1000943	2003432	The desserts here are ridiculously good, even though they have no meat in them.
1082569	2003432	Winner of Best Patio Dining in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! The back garden and surprisingly delicious raw food make it an urban oasis.
1055222	2003432	One day, when I am a very rich woman, I will hire the chef to be my personal meal maker, and achieve my dream of becoming an unwavering vegetarian.
1024438	2003432	If you need\/want raw this is the premier place for it
1078275	2003432	If you want to try flavors you've probably never tasted before, try the Pear Ravioli or Lemon Pasta, both incredibly tart (if that's your thing). Desserts are a home run in a new kind of ballpark.
1078275	2003432	Slap your tastebuds into shape with the raw and vegan offerings. Safer things on the menu (if this is your first raw experience) are the Lasagna and Tamales.
1003744	2003432	Try the raw lasagne (via @Foodspotting)
1007599	2003432	Spanking and Goji High smoothies are awesome.
1196154	2003432	I love the menu here, and the patio is perfect!
1011075	2003432	here's the trick to sitting outside: call to make a reservation. they won't give you a seat as a walk-in. also green apple juice & raw lasagna is sooo good.
1011075	2003432	zucchini lasagna + malbec + salted chocolate caramel tart = yum! plus, they have ferreira port. :-)
1054073	2003432	Sit outside and order one of everything. Lasagna. Burger. Taco salad. Shakes. EVERYTHING is good here!
1043127	2003432	This place is VERY expensive and all you get are a few vegetables. Not worth it imo.
1040642	2003441	Marinated Pork w spicy chilli pepper sauce served with white rice for $10.00! Music is crazy loud and yes like everyone else FAT FREAKING TUESDAYS!
1062736	2003441	This place has a great happy hour from 5pm-8pm! Order a meal and get a comp martini or glass of wine.
1174938	2003445	My fave place 2 eat when I was at FIT! Great memories...great food! Tomato cheddar soup is the best along w\/ the turkey blt!!!

1125639	2003449	Try the Caña And Limón Drink - Sweet and tangy with a slight taste of Tamarindo. So good!  (via @Foodspotting)
1129680	2003449	Order the cocada with any o your arepas FTW
1125639	2003449	Try the La Sureña Arepa - Chicken and chorizo with aguacate. Enough said. (via @Foodspotting)
1125639	2003449	Try the Tostones Mochimeros - Soooo good. Thank you @taniaaaaa for Tue recommendation!  (via @Foodspotting)
1058900	2003449	Long wait? There always is. Go two doors down and order to-go.
1023442	2003449	any arepa with avocado. and don't forget to drink a michelada!
1007378	2003449	The Tequeños are like the platonic ideal of a fried cheese stick.
1231211	2003449	Lunch special for 8.50 on weekday is an arepa+soup\/salad, to stay or go. Awesome and delicious.
1006243	2003449	A15 and a Michelada make a great combo.
1042683	2003511	Get the Cuban sandwich. Wow!
1002442	2003511	if you go, sit outside. it felt so dirty inside. the food was pretty blah, so i'd say go somewhere else.
1001317	2003511	This place is the best in the summer. Sit outside, drink margaritas & beer & eat inauthentic (but good) Mexican food to your heart's content.
1004373	2003511	Try the \
1000102	2003511	They microwaved the enchiladas.
1175163	2003511	One of few restaurants still open past 9:30pm. WTF? Anyway, nice server, pretty good food. Try the beans and rice with carnitas. Yum.
1005503	2003511	BEWARE:The fish tacos are really salty.
1025438	2003521	If you're ballsy enough, try the bull penis.
1039279	2003521	Get the lightly seared fatty tuna!
1059479	2003521	If you don't eat, there is a 8 dollar per person minimum. A pitcher of Ichiban costs 8 dollars. The food doesn't. The menus have gross anime porn on them.
1051445	2003524	The fake steak au poivre is a must have!
1107013	2003524	Fuck a Club Friday (www.fuckaclubfriday.com)

1001163	2003557	Be sure to get DOC pizza and Mexican Coke.
1049206	2003557	Sit at the bar, and ask for extra parmesan on your slice. The dude will freshly grate parmesan for you.
1005201	2003557	MUST try the buffalo mozzarella appetizer. Out of this world! I also had the 21st Amendment Watermelon Wheat beer - awesome!
1003266	2003560	Get the Chicken Penang Curry. It rocks.
1001768	2003575	Go to Sugar Sweet Sunshine & have a Sexy Red Velvet cupcake w their special 'Moose' (whipped mousse) frosting
1006764	2003575	Pistachio cupcake = Happiness!
1048133	2003575	pistachio cupcake with silk buttercream- drool, that good!
1017574	2003575	Spicy Pumpkin cupcake is so good. But the best surprise are the puddings! Chocolate Chip & Banana puddings give the cupcakes are run for their money!
1195601	2003575	Don't miss the pudding in the back! Chocolate chip cookie dough and cream pudding... I'd die!
1034460	2003575	This is where I go to get my sugar fix during afternoons at work. Cupcakes are solid, cheesecakes are so rich (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1027404	2003575	You have made a wonderful decision. Pistachio for sure. Sassy>Sexy Red Velvet.
1208452	2003575	Spicy pumpkin. Just do it. There's no better option, I promise you.
1020711	2003575	Peanut butter buttercream. That is all.
1006360	2003575	Raspberry Lemon trifle was transporting. Cake in cup nowhere near as good.
1000953	2003582	my fav cafe in all NYC. great working environment, friendly, crowd changes throughout day into night
1017476	2003582	Skip this place.  Make an iced coffee and hang out in your apartment.  It's cheaper, there are probably less screaming children, and your bathroom is probably cleaner.
1034131	2003582	diverse crowd. comfortable. good variety of food and drinks. always something new going on. you'll feel at home.
1049714	2003582	Prices are cheap but can do without the live band

1263441	2003723	Nice atmosphere and they make the guacamole in front of you!! Very nice
1196154	2003723	must order the guacamole, which they make tableside fresh.  Authentic tasty mexican food, and they even have live Mariachi music! Great place to celebrate a birthday!
1049412	2003723	Berejena Rancheros = amazing. Fried to perfection. If you've never had eggplant, you won't regret! Sweet plantains are great. Service is wonderful. Great place.
1063524	2003723	the champurrado at this place rocks!!!

1144134	2004156	Si eres fanático del #foodporn, this is the place.
1066227	2004156	Bathrooms!
1049391	2004156	The chocolate chip cookies at Jacques Torres are phenomenal.
1001342	2004156	Bathrooms are opposite The Lobster Place. Pretty decent ones, too. (By NYC standards.)
1038724	2004156	Chelsea Thai is amazing...try the Pad Thai. Always the mark of a good Thai food place!
1029301	2004156	Keep your eyes peeled for new pop-up shops! Swing into Chelsea Wine Vault for a tasting, grab some deliciousness from Amy's Bread and have a 9th Street Espresso before you leave.
1001771	2004156	Split a grilled cheese from Lucy's Whey with a friend and enjoy it with a cup of soup from The Lobster Place.
1006624	2004156	Good luck with the crazy long restroom line

1053230	2004156	Best food Thai chelsea!
1196154	2004156	My home away from home in the old hood! So disappointed 202 is gone!
1000072	2004283	might be my most favorite place to eat on the block
1196154	2004283	Best dumpling house in K-town.  And awesome karaoke across the street!
1040518	2004310	Delicious pasta & light salads.
1002856	2004310	Tip: ignore hostess (rude) but otherwise good spot.
1011372	2004310	The gorgonzola fondue with fries are signature. The Eggs Benedict and French Toast are legendary.
1053783	2004310	Become friends the black guy with hat. He  surely can ditch the sign-up sheet to wait for a table & get u a table, regardless of the 1st come 1st serve. Maybe they should start taking reservations.ugh
1059619	2004310	try the monte cristo sandwich- a great combination of \
1178199	2004310	House cab and start with the salad. yum yum yum

1047178	2004326	Best brunch! The Eggs Benedict are to die for!
1033560	2004326	It's only seasonal but the Pineapple torte was amazeballs. Wash it down with champagne.
1000738	2004326	Steve Jobs used to take his girlfriend at the time here in 1983.
1030939	2004340	amazing food, ambiance & hands down my new favorite spot for a sake mojito.
1019732	2004342	Doing the omakase. It's really the only way.
1196154	2004342	get the omakase, period.  The crepe mille feuille for dessert is good too!
1193062	2004342	The Omakase was terrific, 22 pieces of sushi in all, with a foie gras that just melts in your mouth in between, the only thing is that some of the pieces were just different versions of the same fish.
1196154	2004342	You must get the omakase. Will change your life.  Also, try the crepe mille feuille for dessert. It's awesome.
1005663	2004376	I recommend the steamed veggie dumplings. Hardy and tasty.
1252332	2004376	Get 3 chicken and 3 veggie steamed, and on a really hot day get a snow ice great way to cool down
1252332	2004376	Great food!!! Nice and quit enviorment! Chasier is cute which is a bonus

1023420	2004376	Love this place.  Steamed pork dumplings are my favorite.
1014506	2004389	If you have a cold, there's nothing better than a huge bowl of Lichee Nut's minced chicken corn soup, esp as takeout or delivery.
1026168	2004389	They reuse the soup noodles--really unsanitary!
1022719	2004392	The milk shakes are awesome and a must-have. You can even share them with a friend =)
1027184	2004392	Try the Leg Of Lamb Sandwich - Yum yum (via @Foodspotting)
1004241	2004392	They do Breakfast really well. Dinner not so much. Avoid the turkey, always dry
1031403	2004392	The worst service in the country.
1031403	2004392	Worst service ever. The place is cool, the food ok but we were almost finishing, they took out the plate bring the check and ask us to leave. Seinfeld is a great show, but this restaurant sucks!!!
1027297	2004392	The milkshakes are the only reason to come. Food was pretty blah.
1209553	2004403	Tip the pretty and friendly waitress! Nevermind the other one.
1001090	2004403	The inside is very dark.
1045210	2004403	Try the profitterol! It's very light chocolate with some whipped cream.
1145413	2004403	The service is so slow here...
1050152	2004403	Cash only spot
1006083	2004429	Artichoke dip, macaroni and cheese, cocktails
1030476	2004429	Only place I eat at in Manhattan. Moto in Williamsburg is the only restaurant better than Freemans.
1069093	2004429	Superior mixology, The Old Palamino. Sit at the back bar
1121095	2004429	A hidden gem. Check out the lounge upstairs
1010760	2004429	The artichoke dip is insanely good
1029831	2004429	Without a doubt, one of my favorite NYC spots!
1033560	2004429	the alley might remind you of the scene from Batman when Bruce Wayne's parents get killed.
1057056	2004429	Really disappointing\/slow service upstairs.
1105569	2004429	Get a lattè with your granola to start. Both very good. Then take one Skillet eggs & add a Freeman's Cocktail: rye, lemon juice, pomegranate & bitters.
1029177	2004429	good for brunch
1015416	2004429	Spinach artichoke dip is unlike any other and a must.
1005009	2004429	Artichoke Dip is pretty killer, as is the egg, cheese, and bacon skillet. Take a look at the brunch cocktail menu, too\u2014you can't go wrong with any of it.
1008952	2004429	Great food, cool vibe. Bad server last night who could not be bothered with us. Literally ran away from the table in the middle of a drink order. Heads up service is part of the experience. I'm done

1133605	2004461	The Peanut Butter Pie is quite possibly my favorite, but you can't go wrong with a red velvet or a yellow daisy cupcake. Hands down my favorite bakery.
1025807	2004472	There's a cozy downstairs area behind the counter. If upstairs is too crowded go there!
1034710	2004472	Vegan Peanut butter chocolate chip cookies are bangin'. They also have great coffee.
1056276	2004472	Iced coffee with coffee ice cubes - not THE best ice coffee, but much more consistent over time compared regular cubes. Worth a try.
1086519	2004472	Staff were extremely friendly, space is very nice. Small, but if it gets too crowded, there's space downstairs, and just quiet enough for a meeting or to get some work done! (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1030484	2004472	The iced coffee is the best because the ice cubes are frozen coffee. Also, the salads are fresh and absolutely delicious.

1119217	2004524	The food had a surprising lack of flavor and the drinks were weak.
1146828	2004529	Banana spring rolls with burnt honey ice cream is the ideal dessert.

1049805	2004556	MOTHER OF PEARL is the brisket good!
1025041	2004556	Be prepared to WAIT! Reservations are booked WEEKS ahead and everyone else waits it out.

1000616	2004561	Okay, this place is all it's cracked up to be.  Hint:  if you're looking for seconds, sweet talk one of the tourists in line into placing an order for you.
1003809	2004561	One of the best burgers I have had! Great \
1060041	2004561	Do not ignore the man behind this curtain. Get a cheeseburger, medium, with the works and fries. Consider a pitcher of Sam Adams and stay a while.
1004463	2004561	Ask the concierge to place a pick up order and skip the line.
1028946	2004561	Yum Yum Yum. Try to snag a table if you can, otherwise crowd in with some strangers in a corner.
1043905	2004561	Terrible service - they basically accused me of lying about ordering fries, and not paying for them when I had. Also the burgers are tiny - not worth $14.50 w fries & drink! Go to Shake Shack instead.
1031692	2004561	Definitely, one of the best burguers you can find in the city!
1089566	2004561	Love this place. Time it right to get a seat and enjoy a burger (or two) with the works. Not too long a line on off-meal hours. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1211609	2004561	Know what you want as soon as you get to counter or get to the back of the line .
1015416	2004561	Ask for Oscar. You'll never go anywhere else.

1196154	2004640	For those of you that cannot make the pilgrimage to French Laundry in Yountville, this culinary destination is worth the trip.  Go big and order the 10 course with the wine pairing!
1068409	2004640	Spontaneously go to Per Se without a reservation & sit in the bar room.  The food is just as superb as is the view! http:\/\/MichelleC.tv
1089566	2004640	It was pretty damn awesome. Just think it's way overpriced. It's not twice as good as places like Jean Georges or Le Bernardin. But top notch. Ask for a tour of the kitchen\u2026 (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1202698	2004640	Go for the 9 course. It's amazing.
1231094	2004640	Most expensive meal ever ate in NYC...worth every dime (his dime anyway)
1002501	2004640	I preferred French Laundry over Per Se. Great food but service was lacking last time I was here.

1008663	2004671	try the chicken teriyaki chicken salad
1050620	2004671	The Cubano sandwich is always a goodie. Oh and a warning to you macchiato lovers: this is like an expresso, not a Starbucks style drink.
1015595	2004671	Order the sangria on a sunny day and sit outside
1063386	2004677	Some of best sushi I've ever had. Def sit at sushi bat and go omakase, chef is amazing! Great date spot!

1019426	2004731	Grilled artichokes!
1009218	2004731	The really nice thing about this place is that its big, which is great for the pre-theater rush. Expensive, but really good food.

1066148	2004734	The atmosphere is great on a warm summers evening when they open the restaurant up! Foods great - recommend the swordfish with artichokes. The linguinetti was also lovely.

1071372	2004734	Got here at 4:30 pm to an EMPTY space for some drinks and apps and they nearly turned us away b\/c we weren't eating a full meal. WTF?  Finally convinced them to let us stay. Food was good, though.
1211609	2004735	I absolutely love 21! I feel apart of history sitting where Frank Sinatra once did\u2026 plus there is something so romantic about a REAL prohibition speakeasy!
1008309	2004735	The burger's are amazing. Ask to sit by the fireplace and grad a drink in the big red chairs.
1016170	2004749	Not to be confused with downstairs BLT Fish Shack. All fish is to die for but make sure you leave room for dessert. Apple Strudel in particular.
1015416	2004749	Pick a Fish is the move. Salmon, if you're lucky (it sells out). Lobster Roll and Crab Dip also excellent choices.
1028682	2004767	Great sandwiches! And quick service!

1007599	2004829	Lamb pie is delicious. Pair with a Greek beer.

1007599	2004829	Lamb burger is very good, perfect for lunch. Roasted vegetables and chicken platter is also good.
1033560	2004829	Use the restroom straight ahead. It's a shrine to Telly Savalas.
1033560	2004829	Saganaki rocks. Order it bitch.
1005183	2004830	The 3 outdoor seats are the bomb
1053109	2004830	The red, white and blue is a great deal.  A PBR and six blue point oysters for $8.00.  The raw bar sampler is also good if you want to try all the oysters.  Expect a wait if you go on a weekend.
1011466	2004830	Angels on horseback. Raw oysters wrapped in bacon. Proving yet again that bacon makes everything better.
1016447	2004834	This is how Brighton was meant to be. One of the few places left with that opulent charm circa 1995. Come for the food, stay for the show, and get carried out from the vodka.

1070016	2004843	WARNING: Apparently this place will give you the Real Housewife badge if you are friends with Bravo.  Not the coolest badge of honor for a 24 year old bachelor...
1027297	2004843	Love much of the food here, but avoid the red velvet cake. Way too dense.
1029638	2004843	Wouldn't classify this as \

1204517	2004850	Bun Xao and an order of spring rolls. Done.

1045958	2004889	The Brussels sprouts with chorizo are to die for!
1075858	2004889	Ok, so this place is NOT a coffee shop.  It's a restaurant with a wonderful menu.  A little pricey, but worth every penny.  Get a bottle of wine with dinner, the atmosphere requires it.
1099843	2004889	French Roast now has happy hour at midnight . Weird, I know but who doesn't want a deal at that time of night. It's from midnight to 4am. Specials on wine, cocktails, and beer. So stop on by!
1017723	2004889	I'm with Sherry Z.  Horrible service EVERY TIME I have been there yet I keep going back.  Food is indeed mediocre as well.
1000287	2004889	Dress light: air-conditioning is suspect. Also, undress fully before entering sauna-restroom.
1042214	2004898	The quintessential Mexican food establishment in Greenpoint. Great prices, fast service, and a help-your-self beer cooler with frosted mugs. They also make a decent burger.

1045720	2004920	The Duck, Pork, and Chicken Congee is so amazing. Add a little soy sauce to it, thank me later.
1046026	2004920	You can't go wrong ordering congee, but do not miss out on the baked rice dishes and casseroles.
1011466	2004920	This place has much better congee than it's nearby competitors, worth the trek away from the subway
1059479	2004920	If you order by phone they have egg drop soup. If you order in person, they do not have egg drop soup.
1107013	2004920	forget silverware, eat the house chicken special w\/ your hands..

1096969	2004954	SO dank! Definitely go here!
1037873	2004954	The soup dumplings is comparable, not as good as queens location though, fish (seabass)  ordered wasn't as fresh though:(. If u want dumplings without the wait of other spot, come over here!

1074287	2005076	Castros is one the best authentic Mexican restaurants in BK. Hands down!
1021442	2005076	Good place for take-out, or an affordable hour or two to hang out with friends. I was a big fan of their burritos and quesadillas here but everything is pretty good. Outdoor dining's great in Spring.

1089566	2005426	Pulled pork was great. Big seating area in the back with big tv's and I think an upstairs. Outta the way for most but if you're in the hood, definitely worth a look. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1002605	2005426	Limited seating! Great bbq but don't bring ambivilent freinds...this place is for bbq lovers only!

1015443	2005474	The best waitstaff in the East Village.
1031216	2005474	Beware it's a cash only establishment but they do have a ATM available.

1063917	2005474	Leaving a second tip on this. If you like olive garden you will be impressed.
1063917	2005474	Wow. I think overrated is an understatement. Garlic bread was something my baby cousin could make. Service sucked. PASS
1043905	2005474	Don't know what others were smoking when they wrote tips but this place is NOT good. Cosy atmosphere but food is totally average. Saltimbocca was bland, service scattered. Feels like a tourist trap.

1034654	2005606	Brunch? standard = yummy & a totally solid brunch item.  sauteed polenta = delicious & perfect if you want a little something different (don't be afraid to order a side of bacon)!
1006741	2005606	Seriously, the toffee pudding (cake) is outta sight. We often skip dessert elsewhere to come to Beast for the pudding. Also, the rest of the menu is outstanding.
1002448	2005606	They made up for it with basket of baked goodies. Yay.
1002448	2005606	Slooooooowww service.

1025886	2005744	If you don't have time for sit down do their takeaway counter.
1258445	2005744	Love love love this place. Great atmosphere, service & food. Margaritas are crazy good! Try the ceviche Acapulco (best ever!), quesadillas, octopus tostadas, the ribs and the plantain chips!!!!
1020555	2005744	Hands down the best tequila selection in NYC. BOOM.
1057437	2005744	During lunch time, place your order by phone and pick it up...... They take forever when you order in person!!!!!!! But its worth the wait :p
1069093	2005744	Great place, but food is far better at Mexican Radio across the street! Shredded chicken burrito is best in the city!!!
1066148	2005744	All of the food is delicious but I highly recommend ordering the corn on the cob - it's the best thing ever!
1022896	2005760	get the contraband chicken. really, it's amazing.
1050223	2005760	All the burgers are GREAT... but there's a special one NOT on the menu, called THE YARD BURGER. It's got a really SPICY HOT Jamaican marinade. Sweet potato fries balance it out & have plenty of water!
1031945	2005760	You must get your rear in here and try the Tostones.... They are so damn good!!!
1178106	2005769	PL4 house special
1013095	2005769	I judge pho places based on their table chili paste, and this is an excellent blend
1030820	2005769	Get the grilled pork and prawn (shrimp) vermicelli bowl and ask for jalapeños on top.  Douse it with a bowl of peanut sauce from the condiment bar, some sriracha and plum sauce and stir.  YUM!!
1000104	2005778	Get the crispy dough. It's a really unique and delicious take on a starch with your eggs.
1063353	2005778	Expect a 15-20 wait during brunch, but it's TOTALLY worth it.
1000104	2005778	The potato pancake makes an excellent brunch side for the table. They make a mean one.
1056594	2005778	Had brunch here so many times already and I always get the Croque Madame.  Salivating just writing this!
1037037	2005779	you could come here everyday and not get sick of it. Yes, it's that good.
1082569	2005779	Their double-chocolate crumb cake is divine!
1145611	2005779	Everything is delicious. EVERYTHING.
1005663	2005779	Believe the hype. Babycakes makes superior treats. My favorite are the brownie cupcake and pumpkin cupcake (which is seasonal).
1021442	2005854	Not as good and more expensive than John's Coffee Shop but has a lot more of a New York atmosphere with signed images of news anchors and foreign currency on the wall. Owner is really talkative too
1002348	2005854	Just remember its cash only at Mike's
1082569	2005862	They brought Shrimp Tacos to Choice Eats- Corn tortilla, sauteed shrimp with chile chipotle, garlic, and avocado slice. Yummy!
1047991	2005862	Tacos are by far mediocre. Go to Queens for amazing tacos at 1\/3 of the price. Good election of tequilas. Should you dine.. Ask for the yellow habanero sauce if you dare. Killer!!!
1047542	2005862	Mercado margarita extra spicy = heavenly.
1010932	2005863	try the pork & watermelon salad. seriously. do.
1196154	2005863	Fatty everything.  Nuff Said.  Best Dark and Stormy in the city.
1030519	2005863	Fodors recommended as a 'cheap eat', & then ordered Chilli Crab not realising that it would rocket the bill (!) - but it was worth it. Pork belly & watermelon too - who knew? So tasty... :)
1022056	2005863	Cheapest wine? $40. Please.
1022056	2005863	Stop your gushing. This place is seriously over-priced on all levels: from wines to apps to mains. Get on the train and go to Chinatown. Save yourself about $100 for two, easily.
1082569	2005863	This Choice Eats attendee brought Fatty Devils (Deviled Eggs) to the event and handed them all out before the night was over! Delicious!
1000072	2005867	check out the ice teas here (all diff varieties, herbs, etc)
1034460	2005867	Delicious French cuisine with equally top quality wines. And they're part of restaurant week! Regardless, definitely worth the price if you can swing it. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1234704	2005867	Best béarnaise and frites in TriBeCa.
1048682	2005867	Get some Oysters, they're great!
1000072	2005874	a beautiful new york city classic. to try: alyssa and porchetta. and then make your way down the list.
1008466	2005874	Sandwich nazi! Order quick and efficiently. Try and go splitty splitty if you can't eat 14 inches of sandwich. Just saying.
1213188	2005874	The Alyssa is my fave so far but determined to make it down the list.
1015088	2005874	Keep it simple. The Matthew on foccacia will rock your world.
1024296	2005874	Ask for stuff off-menu. They love that.
1011075	2005874	bombolo sandwich: fresh mozarella + basil + tomatoes + dressing on semolina. best in summer. u'll thank me.
1030502	2005874	Matthew on foccacia is the best sandwich in New York.
1024973	2005886	Love this bar!  The drinks and bartenders are awesome!  Love their little patio!  Can't wait to go back!
1064678	2005892	Bit disappointed by Red Lobster to be honest. I personally thought that Ruby Tuesdays across the street was an all round better experience.
1250159	2005892	The cheddar biscuits were cooked a little too long...
1103216	2005892	Don't come here with large parties. Keep it under 7 if you don't want to be separated.
1133254	2005892	Never go with a starving wife lmao #impatient
1017435	2005892	Oh Emm Geee.. if you're reading this, turn around, pick up your shit, and leave this restaurant immediately. TOTAL BARF.
1061567	2005899	Cash only!!! The brunch is good, standard, a little expensive. But the actual building is very cool, and the views of Brooklyn bridge are excellent!! Definitely good place to bring a visitor.
1095346	2005899	The best huevos rancheros I've ever had, goes well with one of their press drinks. Look out for the super tall waiter! Side note: fiancé proposed to me in retro photo booth here :)
1013836	2005899	Incredible brunch!  A bit pricey, but totally worth it...enjoy the view of the waterfront!
1202998	2005899	They need a square. Cash only is retarded.
1012533	2005899	The best feel-good brunch place in Brooklyn. Best biscuits\/jam combination. They love us, we love them. Yalegurney.com\/shop
1016035	2005899	recommends the johnny cakes. Don't be scared to ask for an extra pickle.
1006359	2005900	Gray and rainy days feel like Paris when coupled with an espresso and eclair from Almondine.
1008756	2005900	So they have great pastries and coffee that's basically rocket fuel, but the most overlooked item is their soup.  Made fresh daily and delicious (if a bit pricey at $5 a cup).
1197936	2005904	The kalamata olive cream cheese is good when you want something a little different.
1213346	2005904	Whole wheat everything with bacon scallion cream cheese
1024506	2005904	Great bagels, but weak coffee. Beware of the VERY long weekend lines.

1060486	2005918	Sweet Mango Chutney Sauce is the BEST! A regular is plenty for one person to finish :)

1044792	2005918	Try the Pommes Frites and spot it on Foodspotting!
1216886	2005918	Need to get back here to try more sauces (with fries). The sweet mango chutney mayo, wasabi mayo and pomegranate teriyaki mayo were worth the 20 minute wait in freezing temps (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1125639	2005918	Try the Belgian Fries - Oh dear... Why haven't ti eaten here?  (via @Foodspotting)
1053109	2005918	If you're a fan of peanut sauce then the war sauce is a must.
1083946	2005918	Get your frites and own the table ;)

1051468	2005939	The Bird is great. Don't get scared by what's on it, the Bayou Beast is superb.
1121273	2005939	Cleopatra Jones rocks!!
1242828	2005939	Okay garlic rolls, but really good pizza.

1004766	2005960	The whole menu is superb, the black rice makes any of the dishes better. And the hot sauces are to the left kinda hidden so look for them.

1048550	2006023	Most amazing bathrooms like ever. Seriously. You won't take a better pee in NYC
1185460	2006023	Bring your throwing stars and nunchucks.
1057359	2006023	Best place to take your out-of-towners, but also great for big groups of people who enjoy some fun. Drink the Rin and get the Steak-In-The-Box. Heaven will explode in your mouth!
1087461	2006023	Bring a sword
1033560	2006023	Use the Ninja entrance!
1195601	2006023	Probably the worst food I've had going out to dinner in manhattan... But they're attempt to entertain you via ninja outfits is slightly amusing- overall; wouldn't recommend.
1030792	2006023	Robert is the best server in the whole place. Have him and expect to cry with laughter. Awesome food. Awesome interior. NINJAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1031706	2006057	Disco fries make everything better.

1018568	2006120	The Egg Sandwich with pesto, fried tomato and bacon is the best!
1168483	2006120	Our food took forever, it was great though.  They have the best pancakes, super doughy.

1086519	2006120	Mac and Cheese was DELISH!

1048965	2006148	it's all about the DUCK PAD THAI
1002448	2006151	best staff and brunch on LES
1001509	2006151	Disappointing!! Especially since I had a few amazing brunches here a while back. Everything was really blah.
1091774	2006151	Get a salty dog because they use fresh grapefruit.juice @aliasrestaurant

1022139	2006158	The Napoleon was spectacular.
1045534	2006175	Good lunch service.  Go about twice a month and have never had a bad experience.  Chicken Paillard is my fav!
1021442	2006185	Thin crust, more of a traditional Italian style pie like you'd find at Lombardi's or Grimaldi's. Tried the Arugula Pie as per Food Network's Ted Allen's suggestion, it was good but sausage is the best
1050489	2006185	Best #pizza in the neighborhood.  It is wood fire oven, thin crust, and they will make you whatever you want. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

1000556	2006187	The cheesesteak is pretty junky but delicious and the mac-n-cheese ain't half bad.
1048751	2006205	The Almond bubble tea is too bitter. Go to the White Swan Bakery on Centre and Canal for good tasting almond tea!
1109481	2006205	Try the Taro Bubble Tea - Nom (via @Foodspotting)
1030484	2006205	GREAT green milk tea boba tea. Student discounts available, too.

1008466	2006251	The pool table is free
1006359	2006251	Grab a whiskey after work or better yet, come back on Sunday mornings for live bluegrass during brunch.
1007378	2006251	Grilled pizza stayed crispy and flavorful. Pork chop was great. Penne was nothing special. Overall fantastic ingredients.
1191755	2006251	Another chill bar\/restaurant with free billards.
1033583	2006251	Come between 5-7 for $3.50 Coney Island Lager beer. Great deal!
1209553	2006251	Terrible bar layout, poor design & servers are depressed and mean
1089566	2006251	Brunch was great. I housed the (grass-fed) steak and eggs and the granola in yogurt was bomb. Live music on Sundays, rag\/bluegrass, real fun. Def going back. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1050377	2006261	Get the Omakase for the full Gari experience.
1008561	2006261	Worth every penny!!
1027646	2006261	The omakase is very pricy but more than worth it. By far my best sushi experience outside Japan.
1201836	2006261	They do vegetarian omakase upon request! Get the omakase at the bar. 14 veggie pieces for ~$50 or 14 seafood pieces for ~$90. Friendly service and the best sushi I've had make it worth every cent.
1020817	2006261	The salmon pieces with tomatoe on top is original and a must have!!
1000058	2006287	In my opinion, DuMont has the best burger in NYC. It's not fancy or unique, but the patty is the perfect thickness, and they've always got nice fresh veggies to top it with.
1034281	2006287	Best Burger in NYC. plain and simple.
1214268	2006287	Indisputably the BEST cheeseburger around. Brioche and handcrafted pickles set off this masterpiece of beef. Nobody does it better. Nobody.

1015416	2006293	Shoestring Fries. Yes. You want them!
1196154	2006293	I love coming here late night during the week.  The beer is on point, and the food is finger lickin good.
1005183	2006293	Blue Cheese Burger that is my #1 fav
1142268	2006293	Oysters, deviled eggs, the gnudi and cheeseburger -- you'll be stuffed, but so, so very happy.

1009686	2006293	Mmm. Grilled cheese

1000134	2006293	Order a burger.  The best.  And I live in Texas so I should know a thing or two about burgers....
1048083	2006293	Gnudi to die for & a fabulous vegetable plate too!

1032738	2007357	Tied for first place in pizza heaven: the clam pizza and the one with ricotta, garlic, hot peppers and mozzarella. Get them both!
1033560	2007455	Rent out the whole place for a private party.
1030961	2007455	Best pizza in Astoria, hands down. It's coal-fired brick oven pizza, so if you get lots of toppings on pie (especially watery ones), ask for it crispy!
1020092	2007455	Ask to eat family style for 4 or more... It's a great treat!
1030961	2007455	Best pizza in town \/ my one true love
1033560	2007455	Eat a bar pie... at the bar.
1033560	2007455	If you can't pay your bill, they make you chop wood for the pizza oven in the basement.
1033560	2007455	The VIP room is downstairs.
1059612	2007455	Note: It's minimum $10 if using a credit\/debit card for a takeout order.
1040642	2007455	The pizza here is pretty decent. But the other meals such as pasta are barely average.
1050834	2007482	It's not on the menu but they will make sesame tofu for you if you ask nicely. Yum yum my fav!
1050834	2007482	Get the sesame tofu, not on the menu, but they know what to do.
1082569	2007507	The $6 veg platter has herb-and-chickpea orbs that are freshly fried-they nestle into whatever they're dropped upon, whether it be cabbage slaw, heap of pickles and pickled peppers, or well of tahini
1214268	2007507	Food is great. They'll show you NO love, though. Smiling is forbidden.
1048072	2007507	Yes falafel is good. Shwarma is my fav. Add hummus & beets to any sandwich. So messy but yummy.
1024518	2007507	We meant to eat BBQ and instead ended up with falafel and all sorts of assorted deliciousness. A wise, wise move.
1078275	2007519	Everything, and I mean everything from Dressler is so well executed with beautiful explosion of flavors. The raspberry beret cocktail is refreshing and light. Duck is tender and melts in your mouth.
1050218	2007519	Lamb Shanks are the shiz!
1078275	2007519	Top picks for Brunch: Eggs Benedict, Dressler and the Omelette. Fresh squeezed OJ has just the right amount of pulp and sweetness.
1032738	2007519	Love this place. One of the very best restaurants in Brooklyn, and still feels a bit like a discovery.
1125191	2007519	Great appetizers. Lamb shank was alright, while salmon was excellent. Try their oysters!
1026958	2007521	Small, medium and large dim sum plates are all the same low price of $2.00 each from Monday - Friday!

1080608	2007524	allow your eyes to adjust before venturing down to the candle lit bathrooms
1022683	2007524	My current favorite steakhouse in the city. I say get the Rib Eye over the sirloin or the filet. Amazing, complete with Flintstone-esque protruding bone. ; )

1028031	2007557	That catfish could possibly be better than the chicken.
1007599	2007557	The Superbowl (three sides plus biscuit or bread) is huge, filling, and good. Mac and cheese is solid.
1036758	2007557	Get the Fried Chicken Box, with Mac n Cheese and Collards on the side.
1026202	2007557	Sweet tea (and yeah, chicken biscuit).
1029177	2007557	makes me not miss Chick-fil-a so much
1009686	2007557	Most delicious buttery biscuit & juicy fried chicken
1010909	2007557	Fried Chicken Box with an extra side is more than enough for a discerning pair of eaters; just get two though, you'll be happier.
1026202	2007557	There's lots of great food here, but you should only order the chicken biscuit your first 20 visits.  Until Chick Fil A gets its act together and opens a real store in NYC, this is as good as it gets.
1022719	2007557	awesome southern food in the heart of the 'burg! =)
1096231	2007557	Fuck. Yeah. Hush puppies, homemade wine coolers. Need I say more? This place is the jam
1217242	2007557	Call me old fashioned, but the fried chicken box hits the spot.
1000099	2007557	Holy chicken biscuits! This place is good.
1152611	2007557	Carolina pulled pork, grits n biscuits with gravy. Southern flair and amazing

1005159	2007583	Get a burger with goat cheese!!! Amazing. Also the peanut butter and chocolate cupcake.
1143431	2007583	Standard burger with Jack Cheese was off the hook. GET FRIES with it.
1001319	2007594	There's a mouse that resides under the raised area in the back. DO NOT KILL HIM. He's the mascot ok?
1000102	2007594	You can spot neighborhood notables like actor Jeffrey Wright often hanging out here, playing on their Macs.
1000102	2007594	Pet puppies, all day, urrday.
1001317	2007594	In addition to great coffee and a surly French owner, this place is typical of the nabe in number of hot mixed race patrons.
1005021	2007594	Don't sit at the counter - it's shaky. Eat the birds breakfast. Boiled egg and cucumber! Who knew?
1005009	2007594	Apparently Smooch is going to discontinue Internet on Sundays, the only day I come by to work. Looks like they've lost my business...
1001317	2007594	My favorite bite is the Tamarama, flatbreads topped w\/sliced hard boiled egg, beefsteak tomato, avocado, evoo, and fresh pepper. Comes with a Flat White (coffee). Dreamy!
1000102	2007594	Site of one of the most epic mayorship battles in Ft Greene history..
1069836	2007599	Best Margaritas ever!
1060486	2007599	Horrible.. Ordered the 'dirty' enchildas and found a super long hair in it... Fail!
1160877	2007599	I got roofied here. Don't do it.
1090026	2007627	S'mac has a dozen different flavors of mac & cheese, all available gluten free.  What more can be said?
1000072	2007627	i usually get the masala or four-cheese or spanish.
1000072	2007627	under pressure of hunger and the long line behind you, order the Cajun and the Masala (both major munch size). sit at a big table (you'll need it, fatty) and wonder why
1098858	2007627	Best mac and cheese in the city. Come during off hours to get a seat. Try the Cajun it's amazing! If it's too crowded go next door and get a take and bake and bring it home with you for later.
1025807	2007627	Try the Thanksgiving Mac N Cheese - Turkey, gravy & cranberry. OMFG! (via @Foodspotting)

1014912	2007627	The alpine is amazing...Gruyere cheese, and unbelievably think chunks of slab bacon.
1075858	2007627	Grab n' Go.  Amazing mac n' cheese.  I really like the Masala and the Garden lite.  My advice is to order out and take it to a nearby bar where they don't serve food.
1008210	2007627	Line was ridiculous, but the Buffalo Chicken mac was AWESOME and best enjoyed on the steps next door.
1022719	2007627	best mac and cheese ever! If you don't believe that you can make a meal out of gourmet Mac and Cheese, you need to check this place out =)
1030546	2007627	Stay away from the Buffalo chicken.  Its just frank's red hot sauce and cheese.  Absolutely gross.  Had to get up before I puked
1147338	2007627	Overrated. Go to mac bar instead xo
1014912	2007627	If you're lactose intolerant, consider the 75-cent lactaid pills so you don't have to miss out on the amazing mac & cheese here.

1022056	2007656	Meal was really really good. Interesting mix of flavors. Burger was a standout. Avoid the dessert. It's made offsite and ours, the flourless chocolate thing, was inedible. And not removed from bill.

1004787	2007663	Scene from Men In Black 2 was filmed her (watched it happen). Don't be fooled, this place is no joke. Pizza is great. They don't need the publicity.

1007224	2007675	Classico with sausage but beware of slowwwww service.

1178972	2007677	Our waiter BILLY was rude and unpleasant. He kept forgetting coffee, coleslaw, and always made an excuse why he didn't have it.  When we asked for a soup spoon he said, \
1249013	2007677	Order the Larry David it is full of sarcasm
1123329	2007677	BEST pastrami and corned beef sandwiches in NY! They don't charge for splitting and they give you as many pickles as you want!

1047859	2007749	Pork Ragù and a carafe of the house red.
1032738	2007749	I would avoid the 7:30-8:30 slot most days. We came on Wednesday at 8:30 and were seated immediately.

1078141	2007792	Gotta get the bacon as a side for brunch. Definitely worth it.
1000542	2007792	get the frenchtoast and order bacon on top!!
1019335	2007792	For brunch don't miss the French Toast or the bacon. Yes, the plate of bacon is worth $5.

1006360	2007792	Their sandwiches are awesome. Amazing bread. For dinner, for any time. Pasta is good, but I pine for those sandwiches.

1049343	2007796	Had the tiramisu - amazing.
1002358	2007797	Just because you serve great coffee doesn't excuse rude staff. No lids for coffee at 1 on a Sunday? Go elsewhere.

1000058	2009460	It's open 'till 2am, so one night when you've been working reaaaaaaally late hop in a cab, head to Blue Ribbon Sushi, and order up some toro.  You deserve it.
1000072	2009460	the blue ribbon roll is fantastic, as expected. you can't go wrong with the marriage of lobster, shiso and black caviar. take your time eating it. then order up another roll.
1000072	2009460	the cucumber wrapped tiny shrimp and the spicy lobster sashimi = makes you forget there is such a thing as an entire 'lobster roll'
1008466	2009460	You can't go wrong with any roll here. Obvi the Blue Ribbon is the best, but even the blue crab california is a winner and I never get california rolls!
1002501	2009460	Get Lobster Sashimi. The miso butter is to die for!
1040642	2009460	The sushi here is well, sushi. Good preparation but the taste doesn't really differ from too many other sushi places. Prices are a little less than Nobu's.

1040536	2009460	Great sushi! Nice Sake collection. Tough table. Always a long wait so be prepared.
1001416	2009463	This location probably has some of the worst service at a Starbucks I've ever had ~ and I'm still trying understand how even though I always order he same thing the price is always different.
1205455	2009464	crab meat salad and tri color roll
1000104	2009468	Go to Brooklyn Fish Camp and have the seafood bouillabaisse.

1262073	2009476	Worst service ever! Went here with a large group and they gave my vegetarian friend a pasta dish with chicken and claimed it was fish. Totally unprofessional, the manager was the worst!
1236944	2009476	$6 1\/2lb burger and beer = great deal.  Not sure its the best burger in the city.
1024436	2009495	my recs: avocado, tomato, cucumber salad. avocado + shrimp + cucumber appetizer. avocado and chicken sandwich. notice a pattern here?
1037934	2009496	Try the summertime.. Under the sakitinis..It's sooo good.. And make sure u tip the bartender that's there on Thursdays & Sundays. She's my friend.
1043861	2009496	Great casual spot, the iron pot fish is amazing

1211609	2009498	Order all the small plates! Stick to that and you will not be upset. Check out the reasons on your review.
1030939	2009498	i prefer the meatpacking location (better vibe) & don't sleep on the blueberry margarita & cucumber cosmo
1053877	2009526	the sickest pancakes!
1124076	2009526	Cheddar hush puppies are worth the splurge
1007076	2009526	There's usually a wait and the place is small and loud inside but its worth it for those banana cream cheese stuffed french toast and goat cheese pesto scrambled eggs.

1040642	2010032	Cozy diner. The hamburgers taste pretty great and same for the pastas. Brunch here is also quite tasty. Prices are a little more than Bel Aire a few blocks away which has food on par at times. But San

1020711	2010197	Their bacon cheeseburger is delicious. Their regular order of fries is enough for two people.
1053938	2010197	Best burger and fries in the neighborhood. Try the double cheeseburger with Mayo and A-1 steak sauce.
1214268	2010211	The food isn't good. There's SO MANY good places to eat in W'burg, don't settle for this stuff. Taco Bell is better & Endless Summer is probably just around the corner. Do yourself a solid: stay away.

1193062	2010604	The sweet tea and side dishes are great, I had the collard greens and baked beans; the bbq is a little overpriced and overrated to be truthful.

1057576	2010635	Chicken salad... not recommended. Chk soup, is good.
1005484	2010635	Not worth the money....unless you're really hungry and need really bad faux-Japanese food...
1069179	2010635	It tastes like the food's been frozen and microwaved
1215301	2010635	Thumbs down. I'm sure you can find better cheap fast-food joints in the area.

1033390	2010680	Great brunch! Had the eggs scramble with French fries & a screwdriver. Bartender was friendly and very on top of seating larger brunch groups in a timely manner.

1034654	2010824	skip dessert here & head to Baked by Melissa walk up window for mini-cupcakes (Spring & Broadway). Open til 8pm, you may have to run & get them before dinner is over but worth it!
1007067	2010824	While the sushi and filled fish is some of the best, still one of the best burgers in town. And be Very nice to Roz at the door during the day. She RULES.
1001317	2010824	The crispy calamari is ridiculous. Tastes like they grilled then flash fried. Addictive spicy sauce.

1155593	2010824	Josh's the man
1098756	2010824	If you're a walk in, avoid the maître d\u2019 (the grey hair gentleman) he's a condescending prick. Food, service and bar staff are great.
1007105	2010824	Sashimi is VERY dangerous as they charge by the piece. Out bill for two (without wine) got over $300 very easily.
1019335	2010835	Their lunch menu is available on the weekends & is super cheap. For $7.50 you can get an appetizer & entree. Yum.

1013895	2010853	Say hi to Nick, the owner.  Order the homemade guac, make it extra spicy. with jalapeños, and wash it down with one of their specialty Margaritas!
1204517	2010853	The fish tacos are worth the $ (go for the fried)
1152611	2010873	Shocked at how cheap the prices were in comparison to other NY places. Maine Lobster Roll is highly suggested
1159682	2010873	Never to return. Even with reservation Hostess was rude, nasty, aggressive! Not worth it.
1199925	2010873	Walked up and down the block 5 times def worth it!!!!

1072667	2010897	The assorted BBQ platter is awesome and plenty of food with te banchan
1078200	2010904	I'm kinda pissed that this is an EXAMPLE. Never skip the burger. NEVER. By far, the greatest burger in the city. Get bacon and grilled onions.
1008663	2010904	Best Veggie Burger in NYC. Side of fries and a Porkslap beer make it a perfect meal.
1031257	2010904	Order the cheeseburger.  Get onion rings instead of fries.
1024436	2010904	royale with cheese. and chips with onion dip.
1026055	2010904	$3 pints during happy hour, but it ends at 7 & on Friday \/ Saturday you need to order food to sit outside
1006243	2010904	I was disappointed when our server mocked us for asking to split a $39 bill on two cards. She cited a $20 minimum and firmly said no. There's too many great restaurants in the area to come back here
1183760	2010904	Amazing burgers. Get the bacon royale with blue cheese.
1033330	2010904	Burgers are not great (fuck hype)

1019732	2010935	The vongole will make ur eyes wet w joy. And pain that you'll never produce anything as delicious in your entire miserable and tiny little  life. Eat it and weep motherfucker.
1000102	2010935	The Pork Shank (Stinco!!) was great, very tender and delicious. Meatballs were tinier than expected and riceballs were larger, both were good but we were surprised they didn't come with any sauce.
1082569	2010947	Try the lamb meatballs with roasted green onion and spicy romesco sauce- this dish was featured at Choice Eats 2009
1000953	2010947	Brunch: Expensive, not memorable, drinks not included.
1005390	2010947	FYI: The chipotle ketchup is NOT BBQ sauce.
1064130	2010947	they offer a whole suckling pig good for 10-12 people - comes with 3 sides (bread, greens, beans) + 2 appetizers and dessert for $600.
1195588	2010947	Worst Service in the East Village. Twice I've left in disgust. Saw a mouse, under cooked meat and nasty server\/manager!
1010760	2010965	The pork buns are insanely good: a massive slab of pork belly in a light fluffy bun.
1011372	2010965	The pork buns are good, but not as good as Fatty Crab in the WV.
1238035	2010965	Aside from the famed pork buns, the bok choy and the beef brisket are PHENOMENAL!!
1063386	2010965	Yummy ramen @ best pork buns in the city!
1022056	2010965	Pork buns are great but intense. If you order them don't get the pork ramen as well. It's a bit much. Both are great though. My girlfriend had the vege noodles, which were amazing.
1011315	2010965	Awesome food! They are not kidding about the Chilled Spicy Noodles. Good thing there's plenty of water. :)
1140970	2010965	Don't know what to get? You MUST order the Pork Steamed Buns as an appetizer. Try the Momofuku Ramen and enjoy it with the Piña Colada Soju! Bon Appetit!!
1056171	2010965	watch out sometimes they close at 11 :(

1042406	2011056	The 4 market veggie for $14 go great as an entree or as a starter!  A must!!
1013880	2011056	Avoid the Burger. Grilled Trout and Market Sides are a better way to go
1030502	2011056	Don't order off the regular menu.  The specials change every day and they are all way more delicious.
1059479	2011056	Beets and goat cheese. Milkshakes. You'll love it.

1047859	2011192	Though not technically in Park Slope, this has to be one of the best pizza bars in the US. (if your standard is real central to north central Italian pizza)

1057014	2011637	mediocre service, bad food, prices not worth it.

1044581	2011641	The red sangria is amazing
1017238	2011641	I would skip this place. The calamari and chorizo was bad and over cooked in burnt sauce. Empanadas were good but not great and not worth the trip back.

1024973	2011717	Great bar!  Nice beer and whiskey selection, the bartender, Calvin, was amazing.  Their hamburgers are to DIE FOR!  I only went for the Women's Worldcup cos I'm a giant futbol fan but I'd come back fo

1026055	2011775	Birth place of Fab.com
1005009	2011790	Such a cute place but apparently cannot make over easy eggs... 1st came overcooked, replacement was almost raw.
1014175	2011792	i'm all about the spicy cod roe onigiri.
1006908	2011792	They have delicious pastries in the morning.
1116062	2011792	The black seseme frappe is the most amzing beverage one can have!

1027588	2011846	die hipster scum. food here is good, but the scene is like a Human Giant skit. skinny jeans, beards and asymmetric haircuts akimbo.
1018213	2011846	The egg sandwich is smashing. Subtle hints of sage, mustard and garlic. The bread the sandwich comes on is divine.
1001317	2011846	They're famous for their burger and it's well-deserved. But don't miss the fresh ricotta starter and the \
1101472	2011846	Ricotta w\/figs and honey. Every time. And the little table at the far end of the bar.
1022056	2011846	Fried oysters. Don't even look at the menu.

1126273	2011855	If padron peppers are on the specials, a must!!!
1196154	2011855	definitely worth the wait, I had the paella de mariscos and it was delicious. Don't forget to scarf crispy bits at the bottom of the pan.

1044236	2011856	Start off with one of the great house cocktails. The menu changes often so check the website. Some items stick around. Fried chicken is a crowd fav. Read reviews online.

1026202	2011856	Some of the best fried chicken in the city and the best I've had in Manhattan. The shrimp and grits also rate a try. The chef is formerly of Commander's Palace in New Orleans so you know it's real.
1043127	2011856	Oh wow. Tater tots. Do it.
1064175	2011860	Save 5 of their cardboard cup slips and return them for a free biscotti!
1007461	2011860	Bad news. Biscolatte no longer allows computers.  That's a big FAIL.  They need to re-think that policy.
1007461	2011860	Great coffee \/ biscotti.  I want to like this place, but such a bad vibe.  Been here several times, but on a recent visit, it was so disturbing to see someone treating others so rudely I had to leave.

1019732	2011872	I once saw a cute red head here. We kind of glanced at each other a few times. It was nice. And surprisingly thrilling considering this kind of thing happens all the time in this metropolis.
1015236	2011872	Power outlets are hard to find here
1043905	2011872	Could they BE any slower here?

1000616	2011881	Naveen and I built half of the original foursquare prototype here (pre-SXSW 2009).  This was before I was drinking coffee, so I was downing like 5 hot a day here (someone's gotta pay for that wifi!)
1045533	2011881	I live for this java...and the owners and staff are so nice too!very loyal.

1011315	2011881	Definitely one of the best iced lattes I've had. And they were playing Led Zepplin, when I was there. What's not to like? :)

1229622	2011902	Disappointing. Tuna was was salty, salad was prepackaged arugula and served in a plastic takeout container. Feels too cheap for the price they charge.

1032855	2011913	great food at good price; really enjoyed bowl of chicken curry and rice; on a cold night the miso udon soup hits the spot!
1049206	2011930	Go to this shake shack because the line is MUCH MUCH faster, and your food is ready in a matter of minutes. Not the wait you would experience in madison square park.
1022982	2011930	Say hello to the best Burger in NYC
1016049	2011930	Great place to have dinner after visiting The American Museum of Natural History

1150051	2011930	So far it's the best burger I've had in the city. The line might be long, but it moves quickly. The deliciously seasoned burger meat is worth the wait anyway. Of course, the shakes are awesome, too.
1036865	2011930	The decision is very easy: Shack Burger. Best burger of any fast-burger chain in the nation.
1005565	2011930	Two lines. One for FOOD & DRINK. Another separate (shorter) line for DRINK ONLY.  Choose wisely.

1011465	2011930	Get the Shack Stack. Do it.
1024230	2011930	Shack Stack for the win! Shakes make good company. Hot dog variations, not so much of a win.
1171647	2011930	This location is frequently visited by people who eat hamburgers.
1038897	2011930	The line is so much faster than Mad Sq Park's! Go for the ShackBurger and don't forget your Cheese Fries! YUMMY! You won't easily forget! :)
1055428	2011934	The employees have no communication skills, you may have to order 3 times with 3 different people.  A joke. Worst Starbucks I've ever been to.
1205591	2011934	Always have awful experiences here. Sad because I work in this building
1205591	2011934	Avoid. Not quality drinks and the wait is ridiculous

1017620	2011954	You will have no idea if the girls behind the counter are flirting with you or not.

1051537	2011989	Historical \
1022056	2011989	The $.95 after every price is a bit hilarious, I mean, glass of wine $13.95, feels a bit like Chilli's, but the club sandwich was amazing, even at $17.95.
1082569	2011990	These guys brought all sorts of tacos to Choice Eats and we loved everyone one of them. Mmm, tacos.
1003266	2011990	Best tacos down in SoHo! (via Scoville)
1013095	2011990	The meat is outstanding, so order the tacos without the onions. Raw and overbearing, they just don't do the meat any justice.

1138054	2012037	get the beef dried curry with a side of katsu. best of both worlds
1043388	2012037	Love J-curry and one one does it as good as Curry-ya -- reminds me of Tokyo but lush. Sweet marble bar and I like how they serve curry in little cauldrons. Recommend the pork but everything's good.
1014912	2012042	If they aren't busy and you're pressed for time before you catch your train or bus, they're very accommodating in getting you in and out as quickly as possible. Incredibly friendly waitstaff!

1025041	2012047	Great tapas! Tight seating in the bar room.
1007487	2012047	Service was poor. Waitress kept us waiting even though restaurant was pretty empty. Asparagus was disappointing, croquettes were good but order only brings two. Overall it was forgettable.

1000104	2012049	For a perfect 1-2 punch, have the pork belly appetizer and the skate entree. Both are amazing and make you forget about the slightly too cool for school attitude from the staff.
1163156	2012049	Steak and Eggs all the way. Scone trumps the Brioche in my book, and their bloody mary's come with a pickled carrot ! Tasty....=]

1034138	2012052	I am completely shitfaced right now and I still think the falafel at Oasis by Bedford tastes better....
1093642	2012052	and there was a hair in my food.
1093642	2012052	I'm over it. the cook clearly doesn't understand how to make the food with out onions on it. every time they f it up. it's not that hard. really.
1028925	2012053	Unattentive service. Overpriced drinks. Just asked us for drinks and never came back to ask us what we wanted to eat so we left.
1140970	2012055	If you're looking for a great appetizer, try the crabcake. A must have is the \

1017435	2012055	1 word: banal. don't bother with the tasting menu (we had the 5 course) -  the sweetbread tasted like buffalo wings, the chilled seafood salad was fine but blah, go with the chatham cod or peking duck

1009803	2012208	Get the fried pork and take it to the park
1008132	2012214	Just got a Vegetarian Powerhouse that tasted like BBQ Sauce \/ Bacon and Chicken. Not pleased. Make sure they clean their tools between your salad and the one with meat before it.
1020092	2012214	If you are a regular customer Rueben remembers your order and has it ready!!!
1020092	2012214	Steve the manager is awesome. He knows how to keep the line moving and great at client interaction.

1062189	2012215	The crumb cheesecake is tasty. So light and creamy. The most comparable I've had to The Cheesecake Factory cheesecakes.
1062189	2012215	Red Velvet cake is great and moist, one slice is big enough to be sliced and shared for two or to go. Just request it.
1082569	2012222	Get the fish tacos- segments of breaded & fried mahi mahi are in a griddled, slightly crisp tortilla, w. shredded green cabbage and chopped onion, & finished off w. a slick of pico de gallo and crema.

1196154	2012222	The carnitas that is roasted on the spit, are you kiddin me?! That and the mexican corn, crackalicious. And you can wash it down with a negra modelo. Done.
1196154	2012222	My personal favorite is the pork taco, and the meat is actually roasted on the spit.  The mexican corn here is damn good too.  Can't eat mexican food without a mexican beer as well!
1072667	2012222	Order at the counter, service sucks
1022646	2012222	Great fish tacos!

1139307	2012231	The food here is really good and inexpensive. Been coming here for years.
1196154	2012231	One of the best places in manhattan for 5 dollar eats! Plenty of things to choose from.

1144744	2012231	Their chocolate soy milk is the best!!!
1027404	2012232	One of the best pizza slices you will ever have.

1061109	2012252	carol singers!
1004693	2012268	So wait?!?! 20% Gratuity for three people?! WTF?!
1046440	2012269	They add 20% for parties of 4 or more automatically then provide terrible service. I guess they figure they can get away with it because of the fine print on their menu.
1025121	2012269	The AC is broken. Unbearable.

1184814	2012277	Best sandwiches in the city. Get there early to make sure they don't run out of bread.
1018152	2012277	#6 cold.  Lines can be long during lunch.  Closing times are early and can be unpredictable.
1075177	2012281	Very good vegetarian options. Nice atmosphere. Good service. Not great but above average..
1088996	2012281	Avoid at all costs. Go to a traditional Chinese place or a fake meat specialist restaurant if you're craving either. This place doesn't do justice to any. Plus it's a little pricey.
1006359	2012282	Stop by the juice bar for a crystal clear cleanser (with ginger) and beat the post lunch slump.

1021380	2012322	sunday nights are quiet and you can eat outside

1196154	2012345	A convenient location for a quick pick me up.
1011023	2012345	Cash only, and often a line, but worth it.
1000429	2012347	fantastic breakfast spot. $6 on weekdays gets you two eggs, choice of meat, hash browns, toast, coffee, and juice. sit at the counter!

1029211	2012386	Strong margaritas good food
1021380	2012412	I think i was over stuffed when i got here so I can't really speak to much to the food, it's ok, the place is somewhat small, not ideal for a party larger than 4 but definitely worth a mention
1043127	2012412	Best sushi for your $ hands downs. This place is consistently amazing.

1082569	2012468	Sick of sucky pre-packed sushi? Say thank-you to the Lobster Place. Their Sushi and Nigiri combo is the answer to your sushi-loving prayers!

1057056	2012476	The Phoenician lemonade is good, but the From Beirut with Passion is HEAVEN!
1000943	2012476	Service was excellent, the food was terrific.   It's pricey and very uber trendy... the place looks great, though.  Eat in the lounge to hack the line... just as nice, if not better than tables.
1007395	2012476	I recommend the warm eggplant dish, the gnocchi, and the snowball for dessert! Delicious!
1000104	2012493	The pastrami hash (often a special) is one of the best brunches in the neighborhood.
1000104	2012493	One of the best bistro-style burgers I've had in the neighborhood.
1001317	2012493	The aviation cocktail here is outstanding. I'm picky about them since they're one of my faves but, no matter who's behind the bar, they are stellar.
1016602	2012493	Grab a growler (or refill your own) w\/ one of the Sixpoint Craft Ales on tap.
1001317	2012493	Oysters, mushroom spatzel, weissewurst, pretzels, tartare & the burger. All FREAKING amazing.
1013999	2012493	Currently ranked as my #1 Brooklyn burger - out of A LOT of other places. Fresh ground daily black angus. Yum.
1013999	2012493	The scrambled egg cheddar on a biscuit is amazing with or without sausage. If sweet is your angle the French toast is tops too.
1024987	2012493	Beef Sauerbraten is AMAZING. Do not pass it up. Vesper Brett is also a great way to start the meal. Nice cocktails too!
1036073	2012493	Steak frites most delicious as a midnight snack, otherwise known as when the wait to get in is no longer epic.
1006359	2012493	Food is good but the service is TERRIBLE. Took over 2 hours to get through lunch.
1000102	2012493	I don't even like bacon that much and the BLT here is one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten

1014046	2012494	while there's unlimited mimosas there's extremely limited waitstaff to bring them.  there is unlimited ass in my face as busboys pass my table due to the cramped condition.
1031216	2012494	During weekend brunch they offer unlimited mimosas and bloody marys. It's a little cozy inside but the food is well worth it!
1064526	2012494	I've never been during the day, but evenings have been great without exception.
1048083	2012495	No big changes from Campo to Il Cibreo.  Reliable for lunch w\/good lunch special menu.  One of the better options in Columbia area for lunch.

1231211	2012496	Order coffee and then look up.
1050489	2012496	My favorite #coffee in the city.  I love watching beans fly over my head.  Create your own blend with coffee from three different continents and smell the roast. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1059796	2012496	Courtney love just popped in
1059796	2012496	Sulawesi blend knocks ur jocks off

1002228	2012497	Rigatoni Firenze is my go to dish.
1013095	2012497	The rosemary-tomato dipping sauce is spectacular. The fettuccine rosmarino is disappointing in comparison

1007924	2012500	get a fresh baguette!

1002448	2012508	better micheladas then barrio chino. seriously.
1033560	2012510	Oldest continuously operating bar in Hoboken. During Prohibition they converted to a beauty parlor and ice cream store.
1069614	2012510	Get the Reuben Sandwich.  You will not be disappointed.  It's to die for! Best in Hoboken and better than Carnegie Deli.
1060211	2012510	salmon was a little bland but fries are delish & while some beers are $$, cider was only $5
1093190	2012510	Tried it after not liking the weekly menu at Amandas down the road. No regrets. Muscles and ponmes frites to die for. Dry rub prime rib and pallae special also fantastic totally coming back here!
1174718	2012510	Part of the film \
1010962	2012542	Still my favorite *$$ in the city- great atmosphere, amazing staff.
1242207	2012542	Jenny is awesome love coming by to chat with her
1027404	2012543	One of Manhattan's best coffee spots in such a weird, nondescript locale. They have pourovers here, but more important to me is the cold-brew. Hard to find as good a cup of iced coffee.
1023014	2012543	Really, no fresh fruit?
1237695	2012552	always eat here when i'm doing laundry. turkey burgers are the best.
1237695	2012552	Awesome cherry cokes. They use a super sweet grenadine.
1083565	2012552	Good food and they make you feel like family
1050489	2012556	Kid is a fun place to go in the summer because they have one of the most beautiful outdoor gardens in the city.  The food is pretty good and the staff is very nice. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1001088	2012556	Try the lamb burger with goat cheese.
1039879	2012568	Go to Martha's.  Get yourself one of their pecan torts.  Like a little mini pecan pie but with a thick, crunchy solid crust and thick pecan layer that gives a wonderful chew.
1222469	2012568	The AS choice: Red Velvet cupcake, Kitchen Sink cookie, and a Black & White cupcake!
1222469	2012568	The \
1004787	2012568	Tripp is a fan if the giant chocolate chip cookie. They warm them up btw so they are extra gooey.
1214268	2012575	I really dig their organic vegetable omelets. Order counter service and sit up front for great people watching on Bedford. Warning: though it may seem tempting, the patio is ALWAYS too hot.
1015397	2012580	Sit in the back garden and order a bunch of pizzas. They are all amazing and better than anything else on the menu.
1016255	2012580	Great at 1pm when all other east village spots have long lines
1193653	2012584	Got here in the first day they offered a breakfast burrito! Score
1092202	2012598	LOUD. LOUD. LOUD. If you want to have overpriced Mexican in the most obnoxiously loud venue in the area, this is for you.
1242835	2012598	I didn't love it. The food was bland and lacked even an attempt  at authenticity.
1000072	2012608	can't go wrong with lunch here. i almost always get the steamed dumplings and red curry pair
1000129	2012608	The drunk man noodles are your friend.
1033575	2012612	Power UP with their coffee with a panini served on bread from Balthazar Bakery...2 registers are now line killers!
1041875	2012612	Come after the lunch rush, it's nice and quiet.
1030502	2012612	Ask for a side of bread if you get a salad. It comes from the delicious Balthazar Bakery!
1082569	2012617	We like the migas- a scramble of eggs with cheese, pico de gallo, red or green hot sauce, shredded cheddar, and leftover tortillas, usually fried into chips
1050489	2012617	The ice cream cart outside during the summer is very special.  I get the salted caramel pretzel. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1027404	2012617	Delish panini's and other brunch items for super cheap, considering its all organic! Salted caramel ice cream is great too.
1063353	2012617	come with friends to share plates. Must try: candied bacon!
1005021	2012617	Get the kale and the potato hash
1000616	2012621	If you order anything but the Fried Pork Chop for brunch, you're really missing out (okay, maybe the poached eggs too). Bloody Mary's (even the one with the oyster) are just so-so...
1082569	2012621	Try the brown butter, corn, and mushroom linguine-auced in a rich slurry of brown butter and corn milk, which pools at the bottom of the plate, where it's soaked up by feathery chanterelles.
1000104	2012621	You haven't lived until you've had a katsu-style deep fried pork chop & cheddar waffle for breakfast.
1042283	2012621	The linguini w\/ peas, spring onion & garlic..amazing. Fresh & light with a kick of chilli, so good.
1013999	2012621	Brunch gets crowded quickly but if you're only 2 you might try a bar seat.
1016602	2012621	Enjoy a Sixpoint Bengali Tiger IPA. A rare find and a fantastic beer.
1005009	2012621	My favorite: make your partner order the pancakes (delicious), and you order the hash (best I've had). Split and enjoy.
1058758	2012621	The Classic Bloody Mary is probably the best I've had. Perfect amount of spice. Pickle Garnish too.
1036073	2012621	Free mimosa or bellini with your Sunday brunch, but not until after 12:00 pm. House rules.
1002720	2012621	Tasty scallops
1043127	2012621	Pecan Pie Sunday is out of control amazing. Bread pudding is right on the money.
1043127	2012621	Amazing & CRISPY fried chicken!! Linguine was so so.
1082455	2012621	Hard to have a bad meal here--but the banana bread pudding is a must--even if you don't have room.
1037210	2012621	Check Out The Chicken & Waffles!  You won't be sorry....
1014324	2012621	Try: sweet potato and goat cheese croquettes, duck meatloaf and their dark and stormy. You will not regret. Go to Mini Bar for a drink if there is a long wait for table; they'll call you when ready.
1000556	2012621	At $11 with cheese, I think their burger is one of the best deals in the city. If you want a great vibe restaurant and don't want to spend $125 on dinner for two.. get the burger!
1103216	2012625	Pinwheels are great but the wings suck. Your better off hopping the F train to Bergen for Atomic Wings if u really want chicken.
1000459	2012625	They have great chili but don\u2019t advertise it on the board.
1061567	2012625	Convenient, easy, good pizza place. Wish it was open later!

1000104	2012636	The meatloaf breakfast sandwich sound crazy but it'll blow your mind.
1042283	2012636	Veggie burger is superb; fresh handmade goodness with avocado, melted cheese & fresh tomato..beautiful lunchtime fix.
1000104	2012636	If they have their breakfast burrito (w\/ chicken chorizo) special rolling, get that shiz in your belly!
1052312	2012636	Don't way the muffins unless ur a fan of larva
1149253	2012636	Staff nice, food great, but the pace of food service is unbearably slow
1006236	2012636	no laptop rule til 230pm; this for night owls who are just waking up
1204517	2012641	Two words: rice bowl. Light and delicious.
1014046	2012641	kick ass screwdrivers and blood orange mimosas!
1021380	2012641	Stopped in long enough to hang with my bud, decor is nice, can't speak to the food, I would be down to check it out again.
1022595	2012641	Sour berry cocktail is the way to go. Muddled berries... yum.
1008466	2012653	expect a wait until about 10pm, but if you wait, definitely get the soup dumplings
1048133	2012653	cucumber in garlic sauce and pork & crab soup dumplings- for the win!
1068155	2012653	Soup dumplings
1005503	2012700	Friday lunges here get you through the rest of the week! Order some onion rings.

1197679	2012700	Very busy during lunch hours, but the burgers are delicious and worth the wait.
1086519	2012700	Shakes are good, sandwiches are good. Just reminds me of a 5 Guys... Nothin special... There are better places with better selections in New York City than here... (1 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1139930	2012700	I like the Grilled 4 Cheese sandwich with bacon.
1001342	2012700	Don't overlook the hot dogs here. Perfectly grilled!
1042746	2012700	Try a milkshake! Thick & rich. Try peanut butter chocolate or salted caramel
1001664	2012700	They changed the bathroom code, now it prints on your receipt.

1019160	2012700	New bathroom code: 9746

1064805	2012700	Sit in the kids seats
1025948	2012700	The regular size macaroni is big enough for two people. Have the side size for individual servings.
1002839	2012700	Chocolate peanut butter shake is very tasty, but not tasty enough for a 15 minute wait at that price (~$7.50)
1073518	2012719	This Starbucks is one of my favorites...
1012215	2012719	Try the Cupcakes - Peanut Butter Cupcake. I heart Starbucks.  (via @Foodspotting)
1178972	2012719	drink coffee and destroy.
1017734	2012719	Iced tall unsweetened coffee in a grande cup with soy + old fashioned donut every time bro.
1000058	2012735	They've currently got a deal running where you can get a three course dinner (app, entre, dessert) for 19 bucks Sunday through Thursday.
1001296	2012741	The truffle grilled cheese may have been inspired by a lascivious Chuck Bass scene in Gossip Girl, but it really is that good. Enjoy with a sidecar or glass of red wine.
1008388	2012741	Impressive, ornate, and romantic place to start or end a midtown NYC evening
1008388	2012741	Sadly Gilt is closed for the summer - come back in the fall!

1077380	2012763	Tasting menu is a steal. Bread Basket=AMAZING.

1013095	2012790	If you look up across the street there's always a girl on the third floor jogging in front of the window. Not even on a treadmill or anything, just running in place ha. Always a phone to her ear, too
1027769	2012790	Love the carne asada.  The wait is long...but worth it.
1013501	2012790	40 Minutes and waiting. Not good for a short lunch break
1066854	2012790	The line is super long during work week lunch. If you go either go really early or not o at all.
1008952	2012790	Order anything and you won't be disappointed. Seriously fresh and well made. It's a long wait but most things that are good take time.
1011466	2012790	The secret must be the flaky, toasted tortillas...
1021605	2012792	Wednesday Night is Trivia night and the Trivia is wonderfully obscure!
1016049	2012792	Four words: Lobster Mac and Cheese.
1043388	2012792	Brunch is generally good; dinner OK but a little pricy; Awesome beer selection. The service is decent, although it can be spotty when they're really busy. They have an open mic every Monday.

1062536	2012792	Try a hum punch or come to our Punch Lab Sunday, May 15th, 3:30-5.  http:\/\/events.constantcontact.com\/register\/event?llr=bfatvmcab&oeidk=a07e3ulg6b9d1d99a23
1222158	2012793	Whatever you do... Try the food. Drink too but try the food. Off the hook.

1031304	2012833	Legit spot.  Think veal meatball is my favorite.
1043293	2012833	Coconut Shrimp sandwich FTW, IMHO. Add a healthy dose of sriracha for every bite.

1105569	2012833	Get the veal meatballs.

1004546	2012903	Wifi password: sheeplove.  No joke.
1019732	2012903	Really great drip coffee from direct trade blah blah blah. Basically this coffeshop signals the incredible decadence of our society. Love it therefore
1008210	2012903	Best coffee I've had.
1086519	2012903	They are serious about their coffee here!! Good thing too, cause I like it that way! Low key, free wifi, but don't order food--$10 for a simple sliced bread sandwich?!?\u2026 (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1149548	2012903	When they have it, La Perla de Oaxaca (it's Mexican coffee) is incredible.
1029301	2012903	Any drink ordered here will be superbly prepared and delicious. Friendly service, the place has an excellent vibe!  It does get quite busy; enjoy a quieter setting downstairs. Dig the light fixtures.
1000068	2012903	Say hello to my daughter while you're there.  This is her local haunt.  Quiet, pretty blonde reading a book.
1054949	2012903	Great coffee! Definitely mix it up. Get a cortado or macchiato...great coffee art from skilled baristas! Great vibe, but check out downstairs too for a chiller area.
1043293	2012906	You'll need to make some noise to keep your water glass full, but other than that Menkui Tei is a solid, happy Japanese restaurant with food that's ordinary in Japan but much appreciated stateside.
1138382	2012906	There are \
1222298	2012906	Absolutely terrible music played way too loud all the time. The ramen more than makes up for it though!

1023853	2012908	Try the lemonanana

1000072	2012910	my spot for lunch when I'm working from home (rotate between any of their four basic sandwiches)
1065107	2012910	Get a rice ball, and then eat it out of your hand while you walk to your destination.
1003021	2012913	Breakfast on the UWS dis is da place!
1036055	2012913	City Diner Burger. This is heaven.

1013095	2012914	Chorizo burrito: get it. packed with guacamole and well-seasoned meat
1038956	2012914	The food is absolutely horrid. The service and margaritas are also really bad. The restaurant itself is nice and has wonderful patio. If you go, just don't eat...
1013999	2012927	The best coffee in the hood (D'Amico BBTP blend) and perfect coffee lids (most of the time)!
1206777	2012927	It's all about the French toast bagel.
1187044	2012927	The breakfast wraps are good but the bagels are lame.
1000556	2012927	Nice people but a bit aloof, coffee spilled on counter wasn't cleaned and they charged me twice for a sandwich and wouldn't have caught it themselves if I hadnt brought it to the cashiers attention
1222469	2012964	BEST burger in Astoria! Order the Cajun Fire burger, w\/bacon, american cheese (in addition to the blue cheese)... You won't regret it=)
1091387	2012964	the Shack Shack\/5 Guys of Astoria. Yummm burgers and try the cajun fries!
1001404	2012989	It's OK that you've never heard of Il Porto, because it hasn't been around forever. But if you want some of the best pizza NYC has to offer be sure to stop here -- it's cheap.
1006359	2012989	Pizza is pretty good, but skip the desserts. Worst cannoli I've ever had.
1000072	2012991	after a long ride, try something simple like their take on a lemonade: purified water, lemon juice, agave. i tried the heavier combinations and i just couldn't take it (need to get used to the tastes)
1001296	2012991	The Peaches and Dreams smoothie with an added liver detox boost will zap away your hangover like fairy dust!
1013880	2012991	The Grasshopper is a perfect post workout refresher... Spend the extra 50cent for the large drink, its worth it.
1178067	2012991	Friendliest staff in all of NYC. Pressed juices are the way to go. Not cheap.
1026072	2012991	Get Grasshopper! Totally worth the money.
1002870	2012991	Cider - get the cider!!
1006088	2012996	Service is wicked slow.
1099687	2012996	The quinoa arugula salad is fantastic. Service takes forever.
1013384	2013015	don't expect to get seated on a game night
1021148	2013015	The chocolate fudge cake is good, but wasn't hot (not sure its supposed to be, but would make it better)
1097107	2013015	Terrance was our server! Awesome! Try the jerk\/hot BBQ mix. AMAZING!
1000102	2013015	Mediocre food, but at least the service is bad.

1030718	2013016	Be sure to finish off your meal with the Cotton Candy Flavor of the Day, and - if you ask nicely - an extra one or two of the housemade caramels.
1059456	2013016	the burgers here are very good. also try the lardon and frisee salad with poached egg. i prefer the location at time warner over TriBeCa.
1001671	2013016	Great for breakfast meetings in mid-town, lots of space, great coffee & service.
1024317	2013016	Great place for a dinner date or a lunch work meeting. I highly recommend the Rock Shrimp Risotto.

1104352	2013017	Holy crap! This place seems to have become 1,000,000x better - seemingly overnight. Almost as amazing as it was two years ago. I love it!! And they're back to a full menu!
1024436	2013028	eurotart. fruit, coconut flakes, and brownie bites. oh my.
1183760	2013028	Great selection of frozen yogurt. I love that it is self serve.
1147338	2013028	do strawberry yogurt w\/ ny chz cake bites yummyyy
1122123	2013028	euro tart is def the best flavor for those who still want the yogurt\/tart consistency and the the creaminess of red mango or pinkberry.
1029320	2013028	If you here on November 15th-mention \
1065308	2013028	The birthday cake flavor is to die for!
1002772	2013033	new favorite restaurant in williamsburg
1012991	2013033	The sake here is amazing, make sure to ask the waitress to describe them all to you. Also the atmosphere makes you feel like you are in Japan, when you're really in Brooklyn. There are also buttons

1177297	2013073	Try the marble pound cake
1133092	2013073	Some of the staff are really nice. Don't let long lines send you away; they're efficient. Try the Trenta size for an extra jolt.
1158275	2013073	They have a bathroom!
1052563	2013073	Venti iced carmel macchiato is the way to go.by the way, anything they make a latte of, they can make in a frappuchino!
1000072	2013074	the lobster burger with the spicy mayo on the bottom is just right (especially when you're really hungry)
1000072	2013074	wednesdays at ed's: lobster meatballs. oh my. two of my most favorite things in the world -- on one plate
1082569	2013074	Try the Fried Ipswich clams-a pile of the fat clams, fried in a light, crisp cracker coating. Tartar sauce with chopped pickles comes on the side, but you hardly need it
1019732	2013074	Ed's Lobster Bar concept expands to it's third location on one of the best eating blocks in the city. Clean. Fresh. Inviting. Impeccable food. Order anything. Be happy.

1000191	2013074	make sure you try fried oyster sliders, Ed recommended them
1008466	2013074	Get the lobster meatballs if they're offering them (wed and sat usually) but make sure you have someone to share them with. Also try the oyster sampler.

1000104	2013630	Summer pro tip: half lemonade + half green tea. Unsweetened is key - just the right amount of sweet comes from the lemonade. Look at how refreshing this looks!

1032916	2013661	Are y'all crazy? The skin is too thick, dumpling is flat, and not very flavorful. Go two blocks to Sweet Spring Restaurant and pay 50 cents more for 100x better dumplings
1202050	2013661	As others have stated, five dumplings for a $1. $2 is all you need to get it in.
1166135	2013675	I ordered the vegetarian platter to go. I choked on a chicken bone..
1030477	2013675	Not spicy enough for my taste but definitely one of the most affordable options in the Curry Hill area. Go for the combo platter and grab a seat upstairs.
1174450	2013675	Good for the price but nothing special. Get the mixed platter not a single dish. Servers got good stories. Mine was from Bombai.

1049381	2013740	Lobster Mac-n-Cheese!! Yum
1045573	2013740	The crispy pork belly will take you half way to heaven.  The lobster mac & cheese will finish the job.  Ask the fun bartenders for recommendations and try something a little weird.  It'll be great.

1011315	2013890	Everything is very clean and fresh. The wait staff seemed very sweet, too. I had the Classic sanwich, which was a bit of an acquired taste for me. Everything else sounded terrific though!

1024274	2013904	I've passed this place so many times because bums sit in the 'open public space' in the front and I decided to stop for soup at 10pm. First time, still a bad idea - \
1090894	2013904	Service is consistently impersonal and aloof, but the food makes up for it. Roast pork with string beans my favorite dish.
1256555	2013904	I love this place @lunch or dinner during Fashion Week
1030477	2013915	Veggie Mediterranean chick pea burger is kinda bland. They create a Mexican black bean burger instead

1051975	2013986	LPQ has terrific breakfast. And with it's large community tables, there is lots of room to spread out for meetings with accountants \/ clients \/ colleagues. A real find.
1003021	2013986	Didn't realize this was so close to my office
1025094	2013986	Normally love all LPQ's but was really disappointed by the very weak coffee. When I complained and asked for another pot, i was told ok, but it will be the same. #fail (2 of 4 petals via Fondu)

1092420	2014015	My favorite restaurant in NYC: fav dish is basil minced pork, the trout fish & Thai iced tea :)
1152861	2014058	The fennel and leek risotto is a must. The crowed is not the greatest I enjoyed looking at the boring guys trying to pickup equally boring girls. Not a good place for Manhattan people watching
1067056	2014064	Actually the service sucks all the time. Sitting here for 20 minutes and no service to be found
1040599	2014066	Every time I'm in nyc I stop by this place for the homemade guac. Delicious. Try with a pitcher of Sangria.

1018799	2014143	Great $3 happy hour. Everything on the menu is 3 bucks!
1039957	2014148	Cute Sunday-morning coffee cafe. Love the house blend. Also, the Belgian waffle with fruit was delicious. Yes, service is a little slow, but it's a relaxed atmosphere to sit and sip, so why rush?

1055938	2015355	Woderful. Great selection of the Brunellos at excelent price. Don't forget to make reservations. Yes, the burrata cheese and proscuitto is the best for start.
1193079	2015355	Careful if you ask for a burrata; it's not the typical burrata, just buffala mozzarella wraped in prosciutto.

1033560	2015380	Big fan of their burgers. Very juicy.

1052312	2015412	the only diner worth your money. The blueberry pancakes are top notch, and they have several kinds of baked potatoes
1014324	2015412	Greasy as hell. Avoid unless you have a stomach of steel.
1016498	2015420	Arroz con calamares is perfect. I get it every time. No need to mess with a good thing.
1104729	2015420	Great service!!!  As we sat down ice water, chips and dip were served.  Refills on everything without asking.
1116122	2015420	If you like your food extra spicy, order your guacamole or other spicy dish with \

1001768	2015463	Try the hot taro bubble tea - perfect cold day comfort drink.
1056535	2015463	Absolutely purchase the hot, Jasmine Bubble Tea. Most amazing beverage to heal and unwind after a busy day or work week. Creamy, sweet and soothing. Ultimate comfort drink.
1014077	2015475	great food and good prices - breakfast burrito with a bloody maria (tequila instead of vodka) for $13. Service was great, but the server kept the change - for a 35% tip, which was overly generous.
1103454	2015475	My first Mexican brunch ... Was very good and had perfect service.
1052226	2015487	The yogurts and sorbets are as good as the ice cream for half the calories.
1122003	2015501	Go for the Pappardelle. Best $12 I ever spent.
1000104	2015502	Check out the great variety of local Brooklyn products: Frankie's olive oil, Gorilla coffee, etc.
1184931	2015502	Great brunch.  Their coffee comes in French presses!
1017874	2015502	If it's not full, put a table between you and other guests. Tight squeeze.

1021920	2015502	bring your best bottle of wine: since they're waiting for their license, it's a free BYOB!
1042214	2015503	Try the Buffalo Wings. They have a unique, slightly spicy coating.
1040642	2015503	Fun to eat the chicken here real late at night. It's better than it seems once you eat the food!
1092420	2015506	The food is good here. But I'm don't like it when they push the trash bin to n fro in the middle of the restaurant. Eww. (>_<)
1051971	2015527	One of the best brunch spots in the mile square (and affordable)! Eggs Benny are spot-on and this place is show off to your parents.
1027404	2015529	Tots! Tots! Tots! Get the tater tots.
1025807	2015529	Try the Feta Burger With Tater Tots and spot it on Foodspotting!

1052713	2015541	Best hole in NYC.  Light mood, easy crowd (if you can call it a crowd).  Really love this place!
1019387	2015541	$6 Yuengling? Really?
1135690	2015541	No specials on Saturday ... That's a first!!
1072800	2015550	Service there is horrible. Much better Latin food and service in the area. Azucar and Boca Grande come to mind.
1020555	2015551	Sat\/Sun: Awesome brunch w\/ $6 unlimited frozen margaritas. Fun, lively crowd and DJ spinning retro jams!
1041557	2015551	Awesome Margarita Nightcap
1022259	2015551	really fast Sunday service! and good omelettes
1022360	2015558	For a place that's called \
1098753	2015558	Service is a bit slow on a busy sunday morning, but the breakfast tacos are well worth the wait.
1024436	2015577	honey dew melon with tapioca - yum
1037895	2015577	Oh, I love the red bean slush. Add grass jelly and it just gets better.

1054251	2015591	Good scrambled eggs with cream cheese
1166876	2015597	Need an extra kick in the morning on a hot day? Iced coffee with a shot from here sets everything right.
1002337	2015597	Seriously the cookies are to die for here. My co-workers also like the oatmeal for breakfast.
1014464	2015597	Try the Chicken Caesar Salad and spot it on Foodspotting!
1050489	2015599	This is a great rustic hideaway in Long Island City.  They make good pizza in the style of the suburbs of Naples, as the owner told me, different from the city. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1091070	2015606	Must have sides are the sweet potatoes and the mac & cheese.
1044236	2015606	Sit-down food without the sit-down wait or price. The Le Creuset red pots hold wholesome hearty goodness that might remind you of a home long gone.
1043771	2015606	Ask for the schug. It's a great middle-eastern chili condiment that they serve with some of the brunch items, but it's a great way to add excitement to pretty much everything on the menu!
1091070	2015606	Great place to go after some hard training at Williamsburg Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (WBJJ).
1049805	2015608	Don't be scared by the term \
1024506	2015608	Surprisingly amazing fries.
1043127	2015608	1. Not the best falafel in NYC. 2. The salad bowls have seriously shrunk since this place opened (the prices haven't). 3. The food is good.
1154221	2015636	Get here on time or you might lose your table. Palma loucas are great though
1022799	2015647	One of the few Taiwanese places in Manhattan. Most authentic of them all. Their soup and dry noodle (??) combo is a good deal.
1122031	2015647	Amazing Taiwanese place. Get the pork chop or chicken leg on rice.
1001284	2015647	Lives up to its name. Order the pork chop ($5.25) of course.
1018626	2015647	Spicy wontons are great.
1181505	2015647	Excellent chicken leg over rice, and the soups too!

1086693	2015692	The sliders are must! Enjoy them with the always killer music being played.
1066436	2015692	I had the short ribs.  I'm usually not a short rib girl because they are very fatty but these were perfect.  I died and went to heaven :) Sides were great too, we tasted all of them
1223691	2015692	Get there early for dinner and grab a seat with a view of the restaurant for your visual entertainment before your AMAZING food arrives!
1017435	2015692	STK Rooftop is now open.. stay away if it's a hot night out.  There's no fans or a breeze.
1035819	2015692	Sherwin is the man.
1037946	2015692	Order the sliders and cornbread, so good!
1082569	2015693	Spicy thai salad, grilled chicken & buckwheat noodles with cilantro mint pesto were their additions to Choice Eats, and we loved every bite!
1005663	2015693	Mooncake Foods is spacious & can accommodate groups. Recommended: Hoisin Fish tacos
1039231	2015693	2 for 1 wine during happy hour!  Weekdays before 7pm.
1056656	2015693	The ginger ice tea is extremely gingery, be careful.
1047991	2015693	Try the Vietnamese Meatball Sandwich (Banh Mi Xiu Mai) (via @Foodspotting)
1046494	2015693	Loved the cold Jicama spring rolls (vegetarian). Sauce that comes with it is deliciously hot. Going back for more!

1060041	2015740	Get the grilled cheese with french fries and a milkshake for a late night snack

1015602	2015740	order the Ruben Kincaid with tater tots. the slaw is also great
1008997	2015743	You may not know this BUT this spot has GREAT (and amazingly cheap) wine and prosecco.  A glass is about $5 and the BOTTLE is aroud $25.  Total steal....
1000133	2015743	Ask to include grilled chicken in the lentil salad. It rocks.
1008328	2015752	If you like stronger coffee than the usual cafe, this is it.
1041816	2015752	Really great edamame, Cobb salad was awesome too!
1102967	2015795	There napkins suck! There like tissue paper

1022595	2015808	get medium spicy if you can handle it. flaming tom yum soup rocks... as does the red curry.

1230811	2015862	What happened to the service? It's gotten ridiculously terrible!
1173878	2015862	My favorite chili relleno in the city!  Ask if the limoncello ginger margarita is one of the day's specials - it's a great way to start OR end your meal.
1065695	2015862	Very mediocre food.
1019408	2015876	surprisingly good lunch in midtown
1207922	2015892	I'd much rather eat here than the overrated, overpriced Carnegie Deli nearby. The staff here at Park Cafe are warm and down to earth. I feel like I'm with family here.
1051971	2015900	This has been one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken for a while. ALWAYS get the guacamole & order the Tijuana combo if you want to try a few things. Delish & great spot to take out of towners!
1052206	2015900	They catered a party I went to... Had no idea it was an option! Def. catering my next event!!!
1005833	2015901	Get the guacamole. Incredible.
1039957	2015901	Best Mexican in Honoken hands-down, and one of the best in the NYC area. The steak quesadilla and carne asada are my personal favorites; cooked to perfection, so flavorful. And, get the guacamole!
1000288	2015901	Not cheap, but generous portions of *awesome* food. Worth making the trip from Brooklyn.
1026583	2015904	For the past 18 years, Rita's has been giving away a free, regular size Italian Ice to each and every guest to mark the first day of spring!
1049206	2015904	Strawberry soft serve. It's whipped and tastes like mousse.
1006764	2015917	You're an idiot if you don't get their apfelstrudel.
1014716	2015917	The apple strudel makes you feel what Kristoff waltz must have felt in inglorius basterds
1049206	2015917	Get the apple streudrel!!! Wow. Coffee is fantastic, the whipped cream in amazingly not sweet. Chocolate almonds, wow. Hot chocolate is so subtle and light. Fantastic.
1078137	2015930	Ask for Adrienne or Desiree... best waitresses!!!
1006318	2015930	38.  38 screens in this place and not one of them is hooked up to a network enabled device?!?!
1017949	2015930	Wednesday is Wingsday
1042214	2015936	You can use any cash register to pay for your order. Besides the popular one by the salads there's also one around the corner by the baked goods and one by the juice bar.
1104634	2015936	Do NOT get a salad here if you're concerned about cross-contamination. Meat was flying everywhere and was landing in the vegetables. Who knows what else.
1091070	2015936	Get the Stock Exchange. Turkey, avocado, tomato and pesto sauce on your choice of bread.
1069836	2015936	Awesome breakfast!
1006360	2015944	Small servings. It's ok but too pricey.
1040518	2015944	The portions are too small but their food is good. My favs: appa, pittu & veggie kottu roti. Sometimes the appa is cold, though.
1027697	2015960	They make the best skinny vanilla lates!
1060893	2016020	Don't eat here anymore. They fired their best staff and are doing all they can to turn this local hotspot into a tourist wasteland
1050730	2016020	Vynl BLT.  That's all.
1027404	2016020	Great decor, great service, decent food, INCREDIBLE RESTROOMS. Love it.
1029745	2016020	Hot wait staff! :-)
1046123	2016020	Was a usual but won't be returning. They changed their menu and the food is worse and smaller portions. I used to love this place. RIP Vnyl
1023014	2016020	The burger is absolutely outstanding. One of the best in the city.
1023014	2016020	The burger
1248686	2016020	Phil Collins is the man...

1032939	2016020	Don't just get the Bloody Mary... Get the Ultimate Bloody Mary...
1040518	2016020	Great people watching. Mediocre food.
1039642	2016020	Eat here- the A\/C works lol
1004787	2016029	Good service, decent food, ok prices. Maybe overpriced but until you are in the know around here it's a good option. Cronin's is the pot when you graduate.
1031762	2016029	Very fresh food and large portions! :)
1101302	2016054	Try the tongue burrito. You'll like it!

1002358	2016054	Get the banana pancakes. Best I've ever had in life.
1036758	2016054	Try the tinga de pollo torta and chips w\/guac. Apparently it's tasty and filling. I want my food coma.
1205941	2016055	Salmon Teriyaki Bento is good, and good for you!
1040642	2016055	The Bento Box lunch specials here aren't so bad. The sushi is pretty good as well.

1146485	2016059	Connecticut Roll always
1057971	2016059	Delicious! You can't come to Red Hook and not get a lobster roll. Both the Maine and Connecticut are delicious, the Connecticut slightly more so.

1022056	2016079	Hmm. Not so sure about this place. Roquettes were under seasoned and boring; mussels were... Mussels. Meatballs were good, light on the lingonberry. Choc mousse dessert particilarly bad. Service 6.
1048016	2016079	The Lingonberry Margaritas and Swedish Meatballs are amazing! (Eat them with Lingonberry and Cloudberry sauce...YUMMO!)
1043850	2016079	Delicious through and through. Go on a Tuesday to avoid the crowds.
1008952	2016079	Crab Cake burger is fantastic!

1019408	2016119	love the ramen here, but it can get so crowded at the lunch rush
1119733	2016119	Best gyoza in the city.... The pork is so well seasoned.
1205941	2016119	The curry rice that comes with the ramen set is really good!
1189342	2016126	The asparagus dog, while not actually meat, is grilled and tasty. Try it with the truffle Gruyere sauce. Yum!
1002501	2016126	Ginger Soda was surprisingly good. As for hotdog...eh.
1002501	2016126	Ginger Soda was surpris
1015443	2016126	Try the asparagus dog. Trust!
1016602	2016126	Pork sausage w\/ either (chimichurri or truffle gruyere)... Add a side of mac & cheese if you're really hungry.
1036739	2016141	PF Changs for 2 is good deal.  Get the Green Beans !
1007860	2016148	great atmosphere for relaxing after a late night in the office. the lighting creates a great ambiance
1118710	2016148	Everything here is fantastic but you must try the croquetas, Calamares (fried squid rings in paprika aioli) and the tortilla is splendid. Of course their gambas al ajillio is spot on too :)
1143708	2016148	Non obvious the blueberry pancakes for brunch are great
1041955	2016167	The oyako-don is good and cheap - both at the same time.

1193804	2016189	Get a Number 26 - pineapple fried rice. It's the best!
1068496	2016195	Get there off-peak time to avoid crowds.
1027297	2016195	No slices here, but great full-sized pizza pies. Grab a beer and wait out the crowds at the bar.
1031899	2016195	Lunch for two is no prob getting seated. Billy the bartender is the friendliest guy in this joint.

1013999	2017282	Huge Starbucks with ample seating inside & an outside patio out back. Also efficient baristas.

1150934	2017297	If you're upstairs at @popburger, bad service and an unfriendly waitress...
1057310	2017297	The service & food are horrible here.  The food was served cold & it took over an hour to bring our food.  Stay away. Plus they spilled a bunch of drinks on a friend of mine. Horrible.
1004787	2017297	Cheeseburger, onion rings and a 7-up is my perfect lunch at this place. Soooo good. Service is excellent as well. Not cheap though.

1000129	2017381	This. Pizza. Is. My Favorite! So good.
1019732	2017405	Was forced to eat here with my girlfriend. Basically the kind of horrendous hosting that instantly ruins your meal before you even sit down. That's impressive in it's own way.
1029745	2017405	Don't go here. The service is horrible. They get your order wrong and are not attentive to the table.

1025820	2017516	Hungry Man Special is great for the travelers headed to the city.
1016180	2017516	They sell out of bagels early, usually way before close time.

1080503	2017546	Please allow the waiter to serve the kimchi.
1193062	2017546	The sul lang tang is pretty damn good here, but the bi bim bap is 1st rate, and the kimchee is pretty excellent too.

1028925	2017698	If the line is too long go to the stand across the street. Same company same taste! It's a pyschological thing why the one cart has a longer line than the other. :P
1010012	2017698	Ask for a lid and get it to go.
1080608	2017698	every1 knows how long the lines are & how much (or little) hot sauce to use. but the best advice, imo, is this : get a cab, ask the driver to double park & to buy your food.[they] prioritize cabbies.
1034355	2017698	Beware of all the knock off carts.. 53rd & 6th guys have yellow shirts and yellow bags!  Thank me later :)

1073774	2017698	Opt out of the lettuce and double down on yellow rice from the gods and the best damn gyro meat on 6th.  Plus get the hot sauce cuz you want the pain!
1047178	2017698	It's worth the wait in line. Trust me.

1261728	2017795	Disagree about the Pho, for $7 in union square, it's not bad.

1045573	2017871	First things first:  the complimentary bread.  I love a good selection, and the corn bread was out of this world.  As far as a main course, I ordered the Scottish Salmon.  It was cooked perfectly.  De
1028880	2017879	Pretty authentic Korean style tofu. The best (and probably the only) place for kimchi biji in NYC.  I like the small plate of fish you get always with banchan.  They also make rice in stone bowl.

1095947	2017955	People compare this to Chipotle. Fair assessment. However, i do like Qdoba slightly better -- especially if you're a vegetarian.
1030477	2017973	With seasonal daily specials and no fixed menu you're always in for a surprise but their specialty is roasted chicken and local ingredients.

1027769	2021826	Best steakhouse burger. Fine bread basket too.

1069836	2021831	The old-fashioned pizza is amazing!
1000025	2021833	Great place, but a few items fall short. Stuffed mushrooms lack a variety of flavors and, even though not fried, are sitting in a pool of oil.
1023487	2021833	The food is ok but the servers are Yummi - wink*-
1098314	2021833	All around bad time. Looks were deceiving. Food and service was awful. We waited for like 10 min before anyone noticed we wanted to be seated, there was no host. Stuffed mushrooms were freezer burnt.
1083311	2021841	Really good pizza in the city with a really cool wood fire oven behind the bar.

1253007	2022158	The unlimited mimosa brunch is amazing! Blue Ribbon used to be my favorite Park Slope restaurant, but this has it beat HAND'S DOWN!
1021920	2022183	Get the Brie Tomato baguette sandwich!

1031686	2022218	Ordering online means nothing here apparently #fail
1039957	2022218	Steak was too spicy for me, and I've loved the steak at other Chipotle places. Won't stop me from coming back, though. A little pricey, but what can you do? It's SoHo.

1018885	2022366	save room for dessert - the chocolate pudding is AMAZING
1016035	2022366	doesn't recommend waiting in the lounge adjacent to hotel lobby. It's dark and secluded. Best suited for couples wanting privacy as they decide between his place, hers or getting a room.
1016035	2022366	highly recommends the lobster stew. It's a little bit messy but well worth the experience.

1043771	2022934	The angry pizza is delightful. I bet that it would go really nicely with some champers.

1001731	2023049	The Greek burger is a surprise favorite for me. The intermingling of the feta, beef & black olives form a unique flavor combination that hits you on the first bite and hits harder on the second bite.
1049805	2023055	Roasted garlic and onion knish is OUT OF THIS WORLD good.

1206530	2023119	Great vibe, great pastries, friendly staff, incredible coffee. I'm obsessed!
1134677	2023119	Ask for a punchcard cuz they don't give them to everyone

1064892	2023124	Surprisingly cheap and tasty Stuffed Croissant French Toast.

1001163	2023136	Check out the shuffleboard downstairs.
1041875	2023138	Singha in a cold glass is a must!
1056222	2023167	Still the best burger in NYC!!!!
1000288	2023167	Slightly pretentious, totally delicious.

1122031	2023209	You can't go wrong with the Shiromaru Classic ramen.
1047542	2023209	Shisito peppers = bracing bites of salty goodness. Ramen = rich, savory ... the definition of umami.

1049464	2023220	Service is pretty bad. Very slow.

1082569	2023765	Try the bamboo pith-deliriously spongy, unlike anything you've tasted-the winter melon provides a plain green backdrop. The broth in which the constituents flounder is chicken-y tasting & soothing

1054949	2028322	Awesome burritos! Don't underestimate the burrito bowl, though. Get it with chips!

1056171	2028415	A Great cappuccino but at 4.50 it's a bit much especially if you have had any of the new coffee shop's cappuccinos. Like Stumptown, Gimme Coffee or even Joe's. They are all better and less &$&

1050940	2028614	They actually do not have a public restroom, but did let my friend go close to closing. An unbelievably dirty Starbucks. The barista was very rude. Manager was nice. No one cleaned til closing time.
1056276	2028617	Why am I not surprised I was greeted by a bunch of rude staff in this Chinatown Chinese bakery...
1216812	2028617	Their iced green tea with milk is really good, I think they use sencha green tea.

1082569	2029471	Say goodbye to bland & boring toast. The poached egg, avocado, & multigrain bread that make up Milk Bar's Avocado Toast is a must.
1082569	2029471	Try the Avocado Toast-a brawny slab of multi-grain that's been browned to its optimum crunch point, with chunky avocado salsa is as flavorful as it is abundant. Topped with a poached egg, it's perfect

1021442	2029660	This was a favorite place of one of my Thai friends. Always order the Thai Iced Tea and the Banana Sundae is a lot of fun. Definitely better than Thai 101 and they do take-out too which is great.
1000102	2029660	Six dollar lunch special is a great price for pretty good food.
1029177	2029670	Delish tofu soups, best in Ktown

1039957	2029705	Manicotti was delicious. Was pretty loud on a Friday night, but a few glasses of wine in and we were, too!

1193062	2029825	Yummy apple cider chai.
1028202	2029828	The service is almost always lagging (especially if Mitchell isn't there to herd the staff), but the food can be relied upon. While burgers are a particular specialty, the pancakes, BLT and croque mon
1027769	2029828	Super burger. Grab a cupcake too.
1015263	2029828	Inexpensive assortment of Wine by the glass.

1216886	2029871	Have gone to Republic for Thai many times but after great calamari and shrimp pad thai at about 2\/3 of the price, I'll be going back to Spice (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)

1248686	2030079	Try to come when Lawrence is here. Ask him for one of his original creation shots.
1008051	2030079	This overpriced venue is everything you loathe about Manhattan; avoid it like the plague.
1021442	2030106	Great selection of cream cheeses and variety of bagels, I liked the blueberry cream cheese and cinnamon raisin bagels the best. Try ordering a burger or egg sandwich here, have bagel halves for bread.
1057310	2030106	It's a nice spot with a variety of cream cheese but a little expensive compared to other bagel spots
1036331	2030106	Ehhh I have seen them fumigating this place heavily. All I can say is I hope no one survived. Bagels are okay. I like the olive cream cheese but I wish they had flagels like @ fresh fanatic
1047895	2030145	Can't say that I've ever seen Lars here either. #ProximityMayor?
1047895	2030145	The BBQ Chicken Salad is tasty and filling - yes, even for guys. :-)
1134304	2030151	Make sure to order an extra blue cheese. You only get one with a 10 piece, and none with a 5.
1017280	2030151	Call ahead. They make everything to order, so it always takes 10 minutes, even if it's empty.
1195601	2030231	Reaalllllly delicious Thai in UES. Drunken noodles are awesome!
1029301	2030231	Cool atmosphere, great yellow curry and Thai iced tea. Tom Ka disappointing, though.

1158446	2030452	Watch out for hairs in your salad!! I was lucky enough for two!
1062603	2030452	This place should actually be called hot and sweaty :( they shush you after 1 and are really rude!! If you like to laugh +talk go across the st..choolo  doesn't allow laughter or happiness.food sucks
1002839	2030452	Garlic knots look amazing, but you can only buy 4 at a time - no single sins.
1011341	2030507	Don't knock the Red Sox if Geoff is bartending
1033560	2030507	Check out the featured beers on the last page of the menu. They usually have something really good.
1033560	2030507	Get the mashed potatoes. They come in two piles: red (beets) and white (potatoes). They're really good.
1033560	2030507	Gets really crowded on game days. Get here early if you want a seat at the bar.
1204517	2030515	Great Ham and Swiss crepe. Made with fresh buckwheat crepes!

1042484	2030518	Great place for the slowest wifi ever!
1000072	2030525	I love this izakaya. Just when you thought there was no cool place to eat in this 'hood. Go downstairs, grab a table in the nook or the bar (only two spots I like) and try everything on the menu
1178067	2030525	I'll die happy when I've consummed every bloody thing on this shiney-shiney menu. I may also go into cardiac arrest. Think \

1043388	2030525	Love this place! Always a wait, but don't be deterred. I recommend: hokke (smoked mackerel), bacon wrapped enoki, and fried squid, but everything good. Cheap draft beer (Kirin and Sapporo) too!
1178106	2030525	must try the pork belly, simply amazing!
1196154	2030525	Definitely worth it if you are out and about late night and looking for a place to eat and drink. Love the skewers, the noodles, ramen, and bangin selection of sake.
1126033	2030559	Try the waffle w\/ syrup and butter. Great start to the morning.
1000104	2030652	I highly recommend going double porky: start with the pork belly tacos (homemade tortillas + guacamole are slamming) and end with the Heritage pork. Oink!
1057576	2030652	Try the frog legs tacos... add hot sauce ;-)
1048161	2030652	GREAT FOOD!!!  A must go!
1183433	2030746	Girls got yelled at by barista for taking a photo. What are you so paranoid about?

1049161	2030863	This place is a DISASTER! Keep walking up Bway, there's a better 'bucks thataway.
1017374	2030863	I have to agree about the slow service yet nice employees. Tables are usually free before noon.
1207905	2030863	Line took a while but barista was a machine.
1207123	2030907	CHIPOTLE FRIDAYS!
1050913	2030926	Rude treatment, not coming back
1075858	2030926	Get Ramen.  This a ramen shop.  Reminds me of the ones in japan.  Counter seating only, narrow, and awesome noodles.
1004697	2030926	Not every Ramen is $6.50 on Mon, but I still loved my warming Mabu Ramen on the first nasty day of winter. Perfectly delicious!
1193062	2030926	Nothing particularly special but pretty damn good, good deal.
1051939	2030941	Order a mini version of every dessert and you'll have a lovely little dessert sampler!
1261897	2030941	I like the fruit tarts -- I take some home whenever I visit NY. My friends like the cheesecake and I would have to agree with them!
1034119	2030941	They have really good Italian ices, and a large is only $2.50. I've found my go-to summer treat.

1000104	2031027	Be sure to have the Pork Belly sandwich.
1000104	2031027	Bark's naturally got great dogs, but their burger also happens to be the best in the neighborhood.

1000104	2031027	Get one free refill on your iced teas. Good stuff.

1022601	2031045	Great staff. Always happy at lunch rush hour (:
1025094	2031045	Like most places in this part of NYC, not a destination but a refuge when you're lost in Kips Bay. Good bagels, very good sandwiches and outstanding & courteous service. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1046145	2031047	Brigitte is tops. Remembers my order and keeps my bagel warm if I'm running late.
1039301	2031047	Iced HAZELNUT coffee is the only way!
1042214	2031052	Use the hidden cash register opposite the panini grills. It's cash-only but will save you some time.
1027404	2031112	Seems everyone agrees. The queeny baristas here will get your order wrong and roll their eyes when you try to correct them.
1048217	2031112	Less crowded than the 16th & 8th location.
1102859	2031112	They removed all electric sockets... This Mother Freakers, bring EXTRA batteries, and write a complaint. At least off peak hours, i need to plug

1131334	2031164	Get an appetizer and half portioned donburi for a complete meal...
1022056	2031164	The katsu don was pretty good. For $12 I guess I can't complain. Large beers are steins, not pints.
1117997	2031167	The ONLY place to eat in NYC! No bullshit.
1015440	2031167	Best naan bread. Mushroom saag amazing. Well priced and equally good valued wine list.

1001267	2031443	Don't let this joint's terribly chosen name fool you... Their diner fare is dependably good and fairly priced in my experience.
1262521	2031453	Reasonable prices, great food, cool upstaires seating area.
1060682	2031453	Borderline shady seating scene upstairs, but decent.
1135030	2031473	get the bhel puri appetizer. spicy but worth it.
1007599	2031475	$15 credit card minimum, just so you know.
1017939	2031517	Owner is not rude; he's efficient and keeps the line moving! Fuggedaboudit!
1006853	2031517	The bagles here are excellent, and the staff is always nice. Not sure who the rude owner is that was mentioned in another tip.

1001342	2031616	Say thank you & vote for \
1225305	2031616	Bad service !!
1066871	2031616	Customer service here SUCKS!
1001342	2031671	The bottle caps are terrific little snacks.
1020537	2031671	Order sweet tea vodka with lemonade and sing along to Sweet Caroline (whoa oh ohhh)
1016602	2031671	The Wild Park sandwich is pretty damn good. Substitute tater tots for the salt & vinegar chips.
1027404	2031671	Make sure to get the Jalapeño Bottle Caps. Yum.
1043127	2031671	Pulled chicken isn't pulled. It's more like diced.
1007599	2031671	If you have a hankering for a pulled pork sandwich, look elsewhere.
1006344	2031671	Try the cornbread. Incredible. Best I've ever had.
1087042	2031672	I have eaten at countless sushi places around NYC, this place is amazing for not only price and quality, but quantity and attentive staff! I will defiantly be back.
1002720	2031688	Solid slice with extra parm
1044026	2031748	Peppermint Mocha and low-fat Cinnamon Swirl coffee cake is a must!!

1025142	2031822	Get the curly fries, they're amazing. Gonna miss eating with friends here
1152611	2031822	Sabrina nailed it on the head, get the burger \
1026168	2031853	I think Starbucks policy with regard to ice water is, from a business perspective (not to mention a psychological one), pathetic.
1006318	2031853	If you are looking to camp out and get some work done, keep walking! They covered most if not all of the outlets!
1011527	2031853	The lines grow and shrink based on when the inter-city busses are picking up. There's not much you can do but come early and hope you catch a break. The upstairs is nice for waiting on a bus though.
1038431	2031853	Good for meetings if you don't need your laptop (all of the power outlets are covered). There's an upstairs area with more seating that's usually relatively empty.
1230805	2031853	Closed outletts. Stupid seating arrangement.
1059945	2031862	Love the lunch bento boxes! Great food, great value!

1016602	2031901	Make sure you get a fist bump from Johny before you leave.
1016602	2031901	Sloppy Johny? Little Demi? Curious George? Notorious Nick? You really can't go wrong.
1022617	2031909	OMG hands down the best flan I've ever tasted!! Mi Nidito Mexican on 8th Av betw 51st and 52nd Sts. The owner's treat http:\/\/ow.ly\/i\/7sAA

1004787	2032008	After a long hiatus, I tried this place again and was very impressed. Antonio has really righted the ship and it is now our favorite Italian spot in the neighborhood. Great food, service, & price.

1001296	2032586	The fish and chips here must have come from some kind of prehistoric sea creature. It's huge. Way too big for one person to finish unless you are the Hulk.

1184931	2032586	They will deep-fry anything you bring.  Anything.

1025787	2032603	order a pitch of white\/red sangria and they will make the drink in front of you
1066854	2032603	The Sangria is amazing. It's quite expensive, but definitely worth it if you're looking for an awesome drink. They even make it right in front of you.
1031216	2032603	The seafood paella is a great selection. A little pricy but you receive a LARGE amount of seafood! And it arrives tableside in a fancy pot!

1105569	2032765	The grilled chicken breast + chipotle mayo is a good choice.
1022056	2032765	Look, the sandwiches are fine. But this is NYC. Nit exactly hard to find a good sanger. So forget the sandwiches and focus on their chocolate croissant. Focus.... And buy. Just superb.
1087167	2032765	Lobster bisque are heavenly. And free potato chips!
1042214	2032770	An entirely different pizza experience than you get used to in Brooklyn. At least a dozen different pizzas to choose from at any time. One slice is a meal unless you're the really hungry type.

1235647	2033047	Luv the shaved ice creams!! So big and so good:)
1040642	2033047	A little cheaper than Koryodang with the interior a little more cramped. But there's a decent selection of snacks and pastries here.

1026117	2033167	Tuna of Gari dish is amazing
1089566	2033167	This is real sushi. They dont do rolls so theres no hiding the quality of the fish behind special sauces and all that. Fresh fish, fresh wasabi, real ginger. Want the Omakase (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1063239	2033167	Order the tuna of Gari.  Each piece of tuna prepared uniquely.  You will not get this anywhere else.

1028979	2033444	The French fries are delicious!
1144263	2033471	The insalate portion of the menu is no joke either. Some of the best salads I have ever had!
1024772	2033471	Mezzaluna does not get the props it deserves (thankfully under the radar of Keste, Motorino, Co. etc), otherwise I would need to wait in line.  Best sleeper pizza in the city.  Ice tea is a must have

1184753	2033672	Crappy slow service! Pad thai sucks and so do the drink prices!
1056697	2033675	I discovered this place right by my apt while my mom was visiting. I try to come back every couple of weeks! Great food and quick service.

1068155	2033885	Reusing the bowl gets you 2 free toppings
1026202	2033885	Go with the Pesto Chicken Paradise w\/ Sherry Shallot Vinaigrette. Tell them to go light on the dressing though and don't mind the line. It moves quick - though Miguel needs to relax.

1040518	2033905	Sunday brunch plates. And best mimosas.

1002448	2034591	Best coffee in the hood. Great small bagels
1001319	2034591	Pay attention to what they did with the name. By changing just one letter they communicated the caffeinated core of their mission and avoided a lengthy and nasty trademark dispute

1049805	2035260	Prosciutto sandwich is sinfully delicious.

1049206	2035260	Great muffins..an actual good bran one. Healthy!!! And the tiny peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are amazing. Sandwich happy hour is great. Wine is good too, go during happy hour for that.

1080608	2035833	it gets crowded here quickly (max 20ish people can fit) come at off peak hours
1195207	2035833	Don't be fooled. You might want to order 10 of these little burgers but 3-4 is all I can eat. They must be the best in the whole state.
1051468	2035833	Double cheese with onions and pickles is the way to go! No lettuce or tomatoes allowed!
1036865	2035833	Chocolate shake was good. Friend said the double is better than a single. Jerry Seinfeld ate here. And it's #13 on GQ's 20 burgers to eat before you die.
1071211	2035833	All you need is singles with cheese and onion. Steak and cheese takes up too much stomach space. Save all your room for sliders, you won't regret it.

1227442	2035863	Absolutely amazing brunch! The warm homemade croissant with apricot jam is to die for and the coffee is delicious as well!
1007831	2035866	toasted poppyseed with butter everything untoasted with creamcheese
1001267	2035894	Something about paying just under $8 for two regular slices (and I really do mean *regular*) is absurd.
1027404	2035908	Already tried the mushroom dumplings? The crispy tofu is also a delight!
1007487	2035908	Wild Mushroom Appetizer was super tasty. I also loved the Grilled Chicken Bordeaux with butternut squash raviolli, sauce was delicious.

1160890	2036314	Excellent chicken rice soup!
1082569	2036389	Try the Schiacciata con l'uva, an Italian flatbread. The surface is strewn with tiny wine grapes and anise seeds, and the bread is slightly sweet. Great for breakfast or dessert!

1209553	2036707	Great but slooow

1235830	2037273	Damn... This crowded this early in the morning...not a good way to start this morning!
1195788	2037273	Big a big smile you always have better service :D
1031898	2037273	Terrible place. They always mess my order up

1021442	2037315	a bit of a walk if you're a Pratt Student but worth it. Fish n' Chips and Shepard's Pies are easy recommendations and deep fried pizza is interesting. Food goes half price on special during Happy Hour

1228040	2037480	Free wifi ;)
1075994	2037480	The best Tasty is too flurry
1014912	2037480	Listen to bands playing at the Continental next door as you eat. (They're so loud, you won't have a choice anyway.)
1138699	2037586	So the service here is not great, the servers are too busy playing amongst themselves and not focusing on customers. They only care when it comes to the tip.

1049805	2037687	Try their grilled cheese - simple, delicious, and foolproof :)
1001193	2037697	Great for delivery but you must at LEAST once go there in person for good karma. Go on a busy night and you WILL be entertained..
1000104	2037842	The Kobe burger is outstanding. 1\/4 pound should do unless you're totally starving. ps: mixed fries are the way to go.
1019335	2037842	The sliders are perfect if you don't want to walk away in a burger coma. The fries are on point too and should not be skipped. Regular or sweet potato.
1003585	2037842	the 1\/4 sandwich is kinda small, try the 1\/2 one.the ice cream with a cookie witch chocolate chips is awesome!
1000713	2037855	Say hello to Eric Friedman and ask for waffle advice
1042214	2037883	Only Greenpoint deli that has both hot food *and* beer 24\/7.
1019335	2037891	The cheese pizza or the white pizza are always a solid choice.
1020095	2037906	Breakfast might be cheap but the coffee is revolting and food tasteless. Avoid

1014259	2038140	You could throw a dart at the menu and come up with something really good. I've had everything, from the crispy duck salad to the scallops - and always with a happy result.
1027404	2038209	What a scene you will find here at the witching hour. Soak up the booze but save some calories by getting a turkey burger for your fourthmeal.
1142939	2038209	Brunch includes a bloody marry or screw driver.
1142939	2038209	Brunch includes a screw diver or a bloddy marry.
1190590	2038304	The worst starbucks in the area! Can take them about 15 minutes to get your drink even when not crowded! Go to the sb on 36th and madison

1141204	2038353	Get the petite snails
1000312	2038408	Authentic Vietnamese served in a big, open, loud dining room. Delicious and fast service and it is a great place to eat with a group. Dish in the photo is #92 - Ca Kho To. Amazingly delicious.

1130096	2038668	TURN AROUND AND RUN OUT THE DOOR.Total waste of time and money.
1086517	2038668	Below par service, food, price & drinks but 'interesting' decor.
1021389	2038668	Waiting 45 minutes for a burrito at lunch with only one other customer is reasonable, right?
1130957	2038668	Eric rules! Get the Patron+ the Marimba!
1006853	2038668	I agree that the place is sub par and pricy, but I also add slow to that. If you want good Mexican\/Texmex go to Lobo 2 blocks down on Sacket.
1006665	2038670	Now with unlimited toppings
1166135	2038670	try the mango!...if you fancy a broken tooth ?

1017238	2038689	Sometimes ordering from their sides menu and making it your order is just as good. Yum leave here happy. Everything they have waffle is great!
1154689	2038689	Whole fish, thanksgiving style. Better than it sounds. A lot.

1052025	2038752	The best breakfast in the area, can't go wrong ;-)
1000616	2038753	You can't go wrong with the sample platter, but go for the meat & potato dumplings too.  Maybe order an extra side of kielbasa.
1022575	2038753	Don't order the vegetable soup its just a potato in a cup
1029949	2038753	Best chicken noodle soup on the island. Overall better eats than gentrified veselka up the street.
1004463	2038775	Wow bad service and poor food. Stay away.
1017141	2038916	Great sandwich menu.
1040736	2038916	Amazing sandwiches with fresh Italian meats and homemade mozzarella for only $7!
1029123	2038920	Um, grilled cheese sandwiches should not be open-faced. Or have lettuce. Also, tuna melts should be melted. Also, boneless buffalo wings should have buffalo sauce on them.
1109481	2038920	If you order the French Dip, get extra jus... They give you a tiny cup of it.
1027367	2038929	Carbonara is made right.wud add more pepper,but not Alfredo sauce.egg,cheese,pasta water.fried mozz is 3 stix w sauce not the mozzarella in carrozza waiter said it wud be. (2 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1114319	2038932	Try the food some great options and recent additions like dulce de leche treats are great ! Cozy neighborhood coffee shop!
1082569	2039072	They brought Sausage (Christian Style), Vareniki with Sour Cherries, Vareniki with Potato, Baked Eggplant Saute \
1237070	2039104	I would skip this one - great atmosphere but very mediocre food. Not what you'd expect in Little Italy.
1038456	2039104	the pizza is so industrial. starting with the crust (which isnt crispy at all), continuing with the sauce (tastes like it was taken from a can at the grocery store) and finish with mediocre cheese.
1013999	2039120	Order via app or online to beat the long lunch lines and go straight to the register to pick up your order.
1025094	2039120	I love Chipotle. This one is as good as the others but pretty busy\/long lines with lots of tourists (no surprise given the location). (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1025094	2039120	I love Chipotle. This one is as good as the others but pretty busy\/long lines with lots of tourists (no surprise given tr location). (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1021442	2039120	If you're getting food here, go for the Tacos or the Bowls. Their rice and beans are nothing special, so the best strategy is to load up on sour cream and meat.
1027404	2039120	This place is always too busy. You should be getting creative anyway and trying out the Koreatown digs on 32nd st. or at least nommy Heartland Brewery next door (with more time, of course.)
1059619	2039230	Ask for a punch card if u don't already have one! Great cafe latte.
1023420	2039230	I had the most sublime Cafe Latte here.  May be the best I've had in NYC.
1007599	2039230	Chai is... decent. Get the coffee, much better.
1043905	2039230	Good espresso, but not the most inviting or comfy venue. Best to take away, I think.
1038448	2039230	Iced coffee is disgusting. They pour hot coffee over ice. So it taste watery and like melted plastic.
1034625	2039230	All their regular drip coffee is awesome
1013324	2039230	They manage do draw hearts in coffee but they don't have wifi and can't do a good hot chocolate
1025651	2039242	My god it's the perfect latte.
1001317	2039242	The attractive baristas and baristos (?) here keep the line moving & put a pep in your step with the super charged coffee. The latte designs = bonus.
1049206	2039242	take your coffee into the lounge! it's amazing.
1010760	2039242	Probably the best coffee in New York - keep on going back there. The hipster outfits are a bit of a turnoff tho - Portland one takes itself a little less seriously.
1082569	2039242	Winner of Best New Coffeehouse in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! Grab yourself one of their bottled iced coffees and plant yourself in the hotel lobby.
1036073	2039242	Their hipster-barista uniforms are as embarrassing as the coffee is delicious!
1016654	2039242	The coffee is worth the wait. The mocha kicks ass.
1049206	2039242	The caramelized french toast. Can't go wrong with any choice here. Make sure to go to the lobby to find a place to sit. Tons of chairs and couches. Free wifi code at the front desk.
1016602	2039242	Buy a bag of Stumptown beans and get a complimentary cup of coffee!
1001090	2039242	An opium den for hipster coffee addicts.
1063433	2039242	Ask what's on the secret podge menu. If they ask where you found that, deny deny deny 4square. ?
1199027	2039242	Wifi blows
1027404	2039242	This place always has a line for a reason: the people of Portland know what they're doing with their beans. Come at a slower time and enjoy your java in the Ace Hotel lobby with a good book.
1049206	2039242	get a coffee and relax.
1005009	2039242	They pull two shots for all sizes, so keep to the small latte unless you want to order extra shots in the medium or large!
1065514	2039242	Blueberry creame cookie. It is like eating cookie dough! Amazing
1078275	2039242	Charming staff and the cappuccino is a little drop of heaven, (emphasis on 'little', cup is mini size)!
1029177	2039242	the only coffee that wakes me up
1012194	2039242	Get a seat with an outlet and charge your phone\/laptop. There are outlets along the wall to the left - not only at the table in the middle. And yes, they do make the perfect latte.
1199862	2039242	Best coffee in NYC
1239948	2039242	Free cup of French press with the purchase of a bag of beans!

1008210	2042728	Really tiny inside, but the lobster mac was uh-may-zing.
1029831	2042728	Good, but smac is better IMO
1008210	2042728	Better than Smac if you ask me. Mac Lobsta is bomb.
1249461	2042728	The mac at Southern Hospitality is bigger. This tastes better though.
1046450	2042775	The Cadillac burger is indeed the Cadillac of burgers
1148837	2042775	Crab cakes are incredible. Alone, on the salad, on the sandwich - doesn't matter how you get them. Just get them.
1010675	2042775	Classic burger. No frills. Worth braving a few tourists and a less bro-heavy ambiance than 3rd ave. bartenders downstairs are fabulous.
1027297	2042775	If you are seeing a show at Lincoln Center, try grabbing a burger here. And make room for the cobbler.
1066089	2042775	Brussel Sprouts to die for!!   really...
1010675	2042775	I'm shocked at the number of bad tips here. This is false. Yes, it gets crowded and the service can get overwhelmed, but that's par for the course with any famous NYC jaunt. Come on a quiet night.
1027297	2042775	Amazing Apple Cobbler.
1013259	2042945	Yummy hot cocoa... get it with whip!
1139190	2043005	No outlets, slow service, $$ beer (even for an airport), ok food.  Prob best option for seated\/table service but that's not saying much.
1042214	2043005	Once you're past security in Concourse D this is the place to go. The beer is decently priced and the bar food is good. Try the chicken fingers.
1008051	2043052	Grab a spot by the window if you're lunching solo, and people watch along 8th street. Great location, staff is fast and cheerful.
1025094	2043052	Carnitas burro w pinto beans!
1063432	2043052	I love chipotle but this specific location is terrible. They're rude, inflexible, and food seemed old.
1013693	2043164	better coffee than the horton's next door
1067859	2043192	Also always ask to sit in the garden and snag one of the curtained cabanas--sooooo cozy in the winter and cool and relaxing in the summer--it's a great escape for lunch or dinner!
1050869	2043192	Curry chicken is slammin

1263465	2043226	The salmon is to die for as is the bread and the veggie loaf!
1026013	2043226	Creative organic and free-range menu. The filet mignon will melt in your mouth. I love Josie's.
1070881	2043333	Breakfast sandwiches are good but Absolute Bagels are much better.
1072723	2043357	Bring a flashlight to read the menu at night
1174167	2043357	Ask for hummus when they seat you.  They used to serve it to everyone, but now they only do upon request.  It's free and yummy!
1223740	2043357	short ribs (sandwich & entree) are both superb.
1036787	2043372	Best bagels in the tristate
1125665	2043372	Whole wheat everything scooped out toasted with tofu veggie!! Skinny girls dream bagel

1051971	2043453	Very friendly staff & super yummy wraps! I've formed an addiction to this place...
1122027	2043469	The worst service ever!! Please go any other at same street!
1069036	2043469	Food is hardly decent. Note to waiters: don't get mad if you get undertipped after billing gratuity on 5 ppl when you're providing minimal service ALONG with a nasty attitude.
1122027	2043469	Menu 10 euros pasta or pizza and drink... But pizza cold and too much cheese (bad quality) and poor ingredients. Sorry , novella is a bad election
1135368	2043480	Another 'tip' Two boots sucks!
1082569	2043579	Captain's Daughter: first and foremost a sardine sandwich. It uses an entire tin of the little fish, burying them underneath a pile of scallions, pickled eggs, capers, and the aforementioned herb
1044483	2043579	You can order any sandwich on the menu and you won't be disappointed
1181505	2043617	Chicken lollipop, blood sausage, and the curry are good!
1050489	2043617	If you really want an ethnic joint this place is perfect.  Himalayan live music paired with surprisingly tender yak.  Delicious! (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1050869	2043795	Wish you had some couches or at least some comfy chairs or pillows or something
1231211	2043795	Get an iced coffee or hot latte. The pastries are from Balthazar and their croissants are like none other
1009171	2043795	They told me the put two shots of espresso in every cappuccino no matter what the size. If you need an extra kick, ask them to add a third. It's my standard there.

1119448	2043879	Tried a crazy vegetarian soup, sooo good! Vegie burger was freshly made
1008466	2043879	Beware, 9oz. is a lot of, um, meat.
1215956	2044065	Not a huge fan of this one. They're usually out of something, but the venue's pretty good.
1082569	2044078	The Village Voice voted this Best Brooklyn Tavern in our Best Of New York Poll!
1014964	2044078	Grab a seat at the bar so you can watch the mixologists working their magic. The drinks are spendy at $10 or $11 each, but you're paying for artistry -- things like muddled lemon and candied ginger.
1016602	2044078	Stop in for a Bloody Henry.
1050489	2044078	I love this place because it does not have the annoying pretense of a swanky cocktail lounge.  It is a solid place with great drinks.  Grab a drink here after a meal at\u2026 (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

1004787	2044217	You can't go wrong here. There is no bad choices IMHO. Definitely definitely definitely get dessert. You'll be sorry if you don't.
1027783	2044217	I know tom yum is to thai as wonton  is to chinese but damn, they make it well here! Nice variety of shrooms with bite and normally the shrimp is part of the soup stock. In this case, very flavorful!
1004787	2044217	The Jap Chae and Bul Go Gui are maybe the best I have ever had. Please don't tell my mother-in-law :-)
1004787	2044217	All of the desserts here are just ridiculous. Fried banana or the coconut cake are my preferred way to end the evening.
1004787	2044217	The Neua Kra Prow is for you - if you like spicy beef with vegetables. I get it almost every time.

1059479	2044353	Grande iced coffee, black, no room.
1025094	2044353	Very chill LES Starbucks. Hard to pinpoint why but I like the atmosphere here better than most. Perhaps because it's on a corner with lots of windows? (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1025094	2044353	Very chill LES Starbucks. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1002448	2044353	One of the best Starbucks work in for a bunch of hours. Very chill, spacious, rarely crowded, great staff. In fact it's the same staff that was here when I lived in the hood a yr ago! Speaks volumes.

1000287	2044441	Restroom in here is a disgrace. Seriously guys?

1248686	2044752	The homemade chicken wings are my guilty secret. Don't try them unless you have superb self-control.
1013999	2044778	Actually on 43rd between Vanderbilt & Madison. Lots of available seating, but one of the few @starbucks that doesn't have an oven for breakfast sandwiches.

1011315	2051231	The pork buns are everything you could hope for. Nom!
1025807	2051231	If you new to wait for a table make sure you're really hungry because the waitress will tell you to wait in the back in the milk bar. I dare you to try and resist milk and dessert. Try.
1029415	2051231	Enjoy the juicy, tender pork shoulder - ordered two weeks in advance. The only way to do it: 20 lettuce wraps, 15 oysters, seven hungry souls, five dipping sauces, a few grains of rice, one full girl.
1024873	2051237	Try the Chicken Potpie (via @Foodspotting)
1071504	2051237	The best chocolate egg cream I've ever had!

1057056	2051302	Rice and beans lunch with baked chicken is cheap and to die for! Perfect post-No-Parking meal!
1057056	2051302	Not Dominican? Be prepared to wait 5 min before anyone even makes eye contact. Even as a regular. Food: 8.5. Service: 3.
1030961	2051304	Tomato cheddar gets me every time! So good.
1027783	2051385	Weak sake knowledge. Asked about a particular one and was told, \
1211609	2051385	Dang! This place was great. We had been hankering for some really good Asian food for a while and Tanuki Tavern didn\u2019t disappoint in the least.
1059612	2051391	Unless your vegetarian, get the steak chili. Even then, I'd probably still recommend it.  It's that good.
1017228	2051419	It's closed. There's another one on 34th and 7th but they're much more expensive.
1093393	2051419	A little crammed
1199142	2051419	helthy food, good prices... and, it's at 5th Av!!!
1156476	2051419	Go wild with their self serve oatmeal in the morning! Plus Au Bon Pain counts calories for you, so you don't have to!
1261848	2051593	No bathrooms
1137818	2051593	Staff is really friendly here.
1201611	2051593	Check out the old-fashioned doughnut !
1215956	2051593	15 minute wait for a coffee. Ridiculous. Don't bother - go to 57\/6th instead.

1047568	2051660	Tuna burger is legit. Go for it.
1072712	2051660	Love the live jazz.  Wonderful and relaxing after my grueling rehearsal...  and they were playing on the stairs...cool
1017435	2051660	one of the better restaurants in the heart of times square. the halibut entree is my go-to dish.
1052256	2051770	Try the Cuban Sandwich - Pressed sandwich with glorious amounts of meat and cheese!  (via @Foodspotting)
1025807	2051776	Don't get the salt bagel. The salt isn't plentiful or substantial enough. Compare to Murray's Bagels. Seriously. Pair with strawberry cream cheese. Salty & sweet!
1015416	2051813	Great spot to loiter with a cappuchino. Starbucks is jealous.
1154689	2051911	The shrimp biryani and saag paneer is outstanding.

1098138	2052207	Get the Tino's Combo. Its an Italian combo that is amazing. Whatever oil and vinegar they use on it is just perfect.
1002709	2052286	Service was great for me! Loved the chicken wrap.
1171647	2052287	They serve hamburgers here, as well as french fries, chicken nuggets, and some other stuff.
1048208	2052387	Not as good as it used to be when it was a block away, and they took some things off the menu, but all in all still tasty

1090894	2052719	Dozens of school kids stream in here on their early lunch breaks. They behave well, but table space an issue
1013999	2052719	Order via app or online to beat the long lunch lines and go straight to the register to pick up your order.
1055358	2052719	They have watery lemonade .. No bueno

1008997	2052878	Must have for summer....try the apricot ale.  Delicious...
1012970	2052878	The Cornhusker Lager is great, and the Indiana Pale Ale is a terrific, hoppy brew.
1090894	2052878	Get the 23 oz. drafts. They're the biggest. Biggest beers = best beers.
1075584	2052878	Food is great, BUT portions are not very big.
1057705	2052878	Back Porch Lemonade, people...It's made of dreamy and rainbows!

1058220	2053029	Go to the bar behind the curtains and say hi to Kuma San. Check out his visiting card !
1020616	2053029	The K roll is awesome.  Avoid the Volcano and Fire rolls.  They are not that spicy but they are fairly bland.

1069161	2053085	Cajun shrimp , if u love spicy food sure u will love it
1103216	2053085	Skip the lemonade, it tasted like sugar water with too much ice.
1050913	2053085	Everything on the menu tastes great! Except for the Pomegranate margarita, it tastes like Nyquil.
1138131	2053085	Try the Shrimpin Dippin Broth---it's delish!
1207248	2053085	When you come here you gotta ask for Lindsay as a waitress,she's a hoot!
1238676	2053169	Really expensive. $6 for a bagel with cream cheese. Cheesecake is good but Junior's is the best.
1151828	2053184	A whole new menu! Also check out their specials menu!
1017435	2053184	the ratio of yellows to whites is 4:1 which means this is 1 of the better ramen joints in yuppie central. stick to a tonkatsu ramen & add toppings. if it's a really cold day, oden is your dish.
1072921	2053213	They don't know how to cook a simple steak. Never again!
1132611	2053213	Service is very slow and prices are double what they are at other T.G.I Friday's. Not good over all.
1043544	2053213	Chicken fingers were brought out literally 5 mins after I ordered. Were prob sat under a heater and were cold minutes into the meal. :( fries were horrible go next door to mcdonalds
1221886	2053213	Worst service ever. Food took so long, wrong order, no refills plus bad attitude
1013384	2053300	Always, always, always come here for the flan. There's none like it. Thick and creamy, big slice.
1019387	2053346	Service is a little sketchy especially when it gets really busy
1040332	2053814	Get the brownie melt ..?
1045015	2053814	I sometimes feel the experience here Is hit or miss and the service is too slow
1038431	2053848	The baristas here are the best around.
1133137	2053890	SushiSamba 7Check out this romantic place with bangin sushi - I love it! Took Emilio there. - Snooki
1245305	2053890	Amazing Sushi! Love the outdoor seating and the drinks!!
1073726	2053890	Come here with money in ur pocket
1017435	2053890	this place is for the beginner palate. good food doesn't need to be doused in sauce. everything here is doused in sauce. do what u will with that info...
1053523	2053890	Get the el toro and el topo
1017193	2053890	This is a great date spot! I am in love with the cava sparkling wine.
1050730	2054011	This starbucks is much better than the one on the corner of 8th and 49th.
1040332	2054011	Honestly best Starbucks in NYC
1020711	2054011	The SB closest to the Worldwide Plaza courtyard is faster & makes better drinks.
1072170	2054032	Mediocre service, OK food... And they added their own hefty tip. Plus: smoky, no ventilation. Will not return.
1197679	2054032	An authentic cafe.  No chain or franchise by an means.  But that also means while the food is good, it's a little on the expensive side.
1013999	2054044	Order online or via app to skip the insane lunch line.
1013999	2054044	VIP tip: Order online or via app to completely skip the insanely long lunch line and pick your order up directly at the register.
1082146	2054085	Salad here is great
1256434	2054085	Large soup costs more than a round trip subway ride to Brooklyn.
1019335	2056006	With a million sandwich options, let me make it easy for you: turkey and Brie. So, so good!
1132803	2056006	Discount on soups if you work in the building. Always mobbed in there.

1010661	2056548	Meat Sampler... amazing. Get the TIMATIM FITFIT app...
1046494	2056548	Just read from the window that almost half their menu is vegan! Need to get back in here.
1118746	2056577	Start with the country style green bean sheet jelly. Sounds strange, but it's really just a poorly named, but delicious hand-cut cold noodle dish. Perfectly seasoned!
1063524	2056577	i don't think you're ready for this jelly
1082569	2056596	Love the bar snacks, like sour sausage offered w\/ basil, mint, peanuts, and pickled veggies.
1023420	2056624	A perfect meal is the eggplant parm with linguini cooked with garlic and olive oil, and a glass of the house red.  It's relatively inexpensive too.  Great place to bring a date.
1207922	2056898	My Italian ex-lover Giuliano lives right by here. I miss him and our coffee runs so much! Maybe we'll cross paths here and rekindle that summer 2010 passion someday. *sigh*
1035165	2057043	Did this...Fried fish and sweet plantains...
1082569	2057076	Winner of Best Vegan in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! The meatless set can enjoy traditional Jamaican flavors, like ackee.
1196154	2057076	Gonna have to second the tofu scramble...really tasty! Another awesome destination for healthy eats in Harlem.
1050377	2057145	Great low key atmosphere and quality sushi that won't crush your wallet.
1015416	2057168	stop whatever you're doing, wherever you're going, and come in to Pepolino! Feels like the quickest flight to Italy.
1196154	2057263	stop by for some delicious baked goods.  Very cute space!
1039252	2057263	This place is a SINFUL DELIGHT.....I LOVE IT!
1082113	2057268	The baristas are the friendliest!!! Love coming here every morning.
1082113	2057268	The baristas here are the beat!!!

1003744	2057281	Try the French Toast (via @Foodspotting)
1024436	2057322	Danny, the cute ex-hockey player turned bartender, no longer works here. Don't embarrass yourself by asking about him.
1000756	2057322	Side of French Fries is pretty large so split between two people ... or skip altogether because they're just OK.
1060041	2057322	Spice up your life and get the Bobcat.
1022982	2057322	Yeah the chilli pretty much rocks
1000558	2057322	Cold Ass beer for $3
1054428	2057322	Food was good, loved the nachos. Waiter was miserable, seemed like he did not want to be there.
1069093	2057322	The Bobcat Burger was \
1041694	2057322	Bacon burger is one of the best in the city
1199027	2057322	Ask to sample drink specials, works everytime
1046048	2057322	Get the 'Cold Ass' beer.
1069093	2057322	BRING BACK THE BOBCAT!!!!!!!!!!
1062390	2057322	FAT CAT, BEER and DISCO FRIES ftw!
1068155	2057328	Worst service ran out of iced coffee
1146467	2057328	Worst Starbucks for seating!
1239400	2057328	Seams that cashier doesn't like tourists!
1117321	2057381	Worst service ever cashier was a rude snob
1029949	2057381	This place is legit. Texas wrap with mashed potatoes plus smoothie. Do it.
1065876	2057404	Visit #occupywallstreet and bring a few people some warm drinks, it'd getting cold and they are fighting so we can afford to keep shopping here.
1013902	2057404	Only one restroom.
1036245	2057674	thought this place was overpriced, plus they charged a $10 minimum for card use (one of my pet peeves, especially at an upscale cafe). devon & blakely down the street is much better value AND quality
1021380	2057674	be sure to try the cookies, hands down the best in the biz and also try one of their delicious crepe sanwich
1021380	2057674	best place to get coffee in the area and the two lovely ladies tending service are always a pleasure to chat with, this talk of Devon & whatever sounds like some paid sponsorship...
1005748	2057887	Alot an extra 20min for the sloooow service! So slow, pick it up.
1001894	2057918	$2.50 camembert? This is my jam.
1211794	2058085	Do not leave with out taking a rummy rum cake with you.. also strawberry wine Mercadel is divine.
1259692	2058389	Just when you think you can't get nothing to eat there is places like this that can help you with your hunger :-D
1106704	2058432	#1 Special, spicy is usually ready to go
1042683	2058494	Wish they would install a webcam so you could check the lines on rufus
1082569	2058893	Don\u2019t burn your tongue while tasting their Mallawah Press Toast \u2013 a yummy combo of sliced egg, sharp olives, Swiss cheese, and hot pepper sauce.
1025094	2058893	Is there such a thing as a bad crepe stand? (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1261848	2058893	Get the original with milk chocolate instead of nutella. The bomb
1135804	2058906	The last time I went the service was crappy but overall the food is great
1114319	2058906	Have the crab cake at least once ! :)
1114319	2058906	The outdoor seating area is truly a hidden gem.
1054251	2058944	We love this restaurant.  Risotta. Was great, ravioli even better
1054251	2058944	Love this place, so romantic, and really good food too
1072667	2059059	The $10 credit card minimum is a little annoying with all their lunch specials under $10
1039231	2059059	The pad key Mao is yummy!
1029949	2059566	They have a $10k clover. Get a coffee made with this magical machine.
1046145	2059650	Actually an awesome spot to get some reading\/working\/studying done.
1048083	2059697	The BEST.  Always a pleasure for lunch.  Service always good & never a bad meal.  Saganaki is a MUST.  Don't even think about not ordering it.
1069036	2059727	Lychee sake will knock your socks off!
1087196	2059804	Crowded !!!!!
1084552	2059804	Call ahead of time and put your name on the list! Sometimes the wait is ridiculous!
1082569	2060031	Inspired by the regional Mexican cooking of Chicago's Rick Bayless, Cascabel is filled with scrumptious surprises, from the taco stuffed with homemade chorizo to the massive chile-braised beef rib.
1026729	2060031	No mention of the fish tacos???  Frigging awesome. And you are what you eat, which is why I'm awesome.
1068798	2060031	The mild guacamole is just that - good, but very mild. However, the Medium guac practically burned my mouth off! My advice: get the Mild with a side of jalepenos so you can adjust the spice yourself.
1063386	2060031	Cucumber margarita rocks! Yummy tacos! Finally a decent place on UES!
1216886	2060031	Right around the corner from my apartment - been here a few times for margaritas, beer, tacos & grilled corn. Nice atmosphere, food is good but a little pricy for what it is (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1089566	2060031	Great baja fish tacos. Carnitas was mediocre. Heard the chicken was bomb too. Some good beers and solid drinks. Try El Capitan, stay away from pomegranate hibiscus margarita. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1195601	2060031	Great UES spot - Guac & Saturday Tilapia special was delish. Cucumber & Cilantro marg was a little weak.
1048639	2060031	Try the cucumber or watermelon margaritas. Yummy and refreshing!
1193062	2060031	Had one of the egg dishes, was pretty awesome.
1107013	2060031	Vegetarians be advised, the beans are cooked with pork fat.
1106855	2060120	Same empanadas as Empanada Mama in Hell's Kitchen but at a fraction of the price!
1222355	2060120	So far, the best empanadas I tried in NY (not as good as in Argentina, of course :D) They have a wide variety, both fried and baked.
1030573	2060698	Get bartender Chris to make you a \
1263441	2061118	Best bandeja campesina evvveeer try it
1004787	2061118	This place has the food pre cooked and waiting on the counter in the kitchen. It will come out instantly. Not great.
1040874	2061118	The chicken quesadilla is my favorite. The pork chip is good too!  Don't forget the green sauce.
1040642	2061118	Portions here are HUGE.
1004787	2061118	The food is good here if it's crowded. If it's dead your food will come out instantly (read between the lines here). Service is good. Get the fried yuka and any grilled meat. Flan is nice too.
1216629	2061132	a salad i actually finished completely!
1017034	2061132	Come in and see the place.  New look, same good food!  And the girls are friendly and warm to talk to!
1017034	2061132	The girls here are sweet as can be and are very helpfull these ladies deserve a nice tip in the box when you leave.
1208636	2061132	Love their smoothies!
1064600	2061168	It would be a sin not to order the sticky honey wings.
1162587	2061168	Love this place... The midtown one is good too!
1002839	2061207	Make sure to all for a receipt if you need one or drama ensues.
1043577	2061210	really amazing place!! I think it is a secret!
1024468	2061210	Needs even more locations!
1082569	2061274	Try the Duck Pate with Confit Gizzard- they brought it to Choice Eats last year and everyone loved it!
1002448	2061274	Cauliflower. Meatballs. Can't go wrong with any dish. And the service is excellent.
1004697	2061274	The bartenders are saucy, sassy and Southern.  This girl could not be more happy. Oh, it helps that that food and drinks are top notch as well. You can Spatzle me all day, boys.
1118709	2061285	5% off if u pay with cash
1040642	2061285	The Korean food here is pretty decent. Typical Korean food. Nice decor and atmosphere. Buta Kimchi Yumatei is nice and spicy.

1038701	2064714	The chicken Marsala is a must here. Always a lot, piled with mushrooms and sauce. So good!
1018562	2064823	The chocolate chip muffin here is cookie crunchy on the muffin top and resembles marbled cake on the inside, and bit candy bar-like chunks of real chocolate all over it. Like a muffin caricature.
1049177	2064882	The fountain sodas always taste a little syrupie
1030546	2064882	Grandma Slice - best slice in New York City. Period.
1170055	2064882	Sicilian is my favorite!!!!!

1009527	2064895	one of the best Pad Thai in town
1220081	2064971	Plan a little extra time for a visit; not the best staffed SBs.
1202998	2065011	Too crowded and really shitty Internet
1036661	2065095	There salads r the shit and I don't like salads!

1066409	2065095	Haven't been there in years but it's such a welcome oasis in the middle of the city!
1036661	2065095	Everything is awesome except for the bread. Please change the bread. The free breadthat is...
1015416	2065112	The nicest staff. Its incredible.
1040642	2065142	The internet may be free but it's horridly slow.
1079452	2065144	Try spaghetti alla pirata without tomato source. It's much better.
1025094	2065144	Good cozy italian on LaGuardia. Pizza is better than other dishes but all in all pretty, pretty good. (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1016255	2065189	During weekdays, you have to get here before 11:45am or else there's a 30 minute wait.
1005183	2065189	Get a side of Crack sauce with your Carne Asada Burrito.
1042696	2065189	100% worth the wait.  Pulled Pork burrito - can't go wrong.  Go for the crack sauce.
1175941	2066081	Try the ricotta and orange honey crostini. $2.50! Holy crap... yum.
1080104	2066081	The price is right, but the service is a bit passive-aggressive and it also pissed me off that they don't have a bread basket. Meatballs were phenominal.
1013880	2066081	Pasta here = #fail
1057992	2066081	Try the pannacotta with honey and rosemary. One of the best I've had in the city.
1089566	2066081	Paninos looked good. Meatballs were decent. No meatball shop meatballs, but pretty solid for brunch. Check in for a free Bellini! (3 of 4 petals via Fondu)

1204577	2067049	Food is amazing, ask what soups they have today all will be delish!!
1052962	2067064	Garlic steak is to die for. Mushroom risotto is amazing too!
1114319	2067064	We prefer this location to the midtown one-remember that neither dessert,coffee ,nor wine are included in pre-fixe price. And we eat lightly for the week before and after coming here !
1022601	2068004	I always have their chicken once a week.... Amazing !
1057981	2068070	Get the butter chicken omusubi!
1002720	2068216	Re: the previous discussion of \
1158442	2068216	They have horrible customer service.  Stop trashing each other and take care of the people who are paying.
1002720	2068216	@Ryan S. Thanks 4 the tip. I am now carefully avoiding any semen or suspected semen or semen-like substance in the Starbucks loo. Not an easy thing to verify. But I also noticed suspicious fluid too.
1009409	2068216	I love the staff here.
1038005	2068311	Watch out for Luis...
1038005	2068311	Seriously. Look out for Luis.
1082569	2068453	Village Voice is excited to have Testaccio at the 2012 ChoiceEats food fest!  Full list of restaurants here: http:\/\/ow.ly\/8QjDQ
1039371	2068453	The dessert gelato wasn't any good. $8 for melted gelato, 4 strawberries and sugar isn't worth it. The rest of the food was great, sea scallops with crabmeat was delicious.
1056867	2068829	Awesome brunch spot and all you can drink champagne cocktails. Start off classy and leave a hot mess all before 2pm!
1024873	2068829	Try the cucumber happy hour cocktail...it's crisp, refreshing and OUT OF THIS WORLD.
1208636	2068829	Loved their south african wine from Seven Sisters, but they don't carry it anymore.  Too bad!  Food is excellent!
1048682	2068935	The employees are really sweet and friendly.
1000953	2068935	Decent but lacks WiFi and character of other Thinks
1007599	2068935	My favorite: the Spanish Latte.
1021881	2068935	Two bucks flat for a cup of Joe! In and out!
1043905	2068935	Coffee is great, bagels are good, grilled cheese is totally forgettable.
1027168	2068935	No wifi. Kind of a bummer.
1142669	2068935	Try the spanish latte. Mainly a haven for students, writers, and readers. If you want wifi go to the campus location or starbucks. Its not a problem for the rest of us.
1000006	2068983	Nice vibe in here. They give too much pasta, though.
1131041	2069141	My favorite Starbucks to go to!
1189093	2069215	The X Sandwich w tater tots is pretty awesome. Trying out the steak and eggs today!

1055098	2069521	Amazing food, and some of the best drinks around! Great for sharing.
1075042	2069521	chicken lettuce wrap rocks
1004787	2069575	If you're not a regular here, don't expect any special treatment. It's so-so at best to begin with so I recommend avoiding it.
1004787	2069575	Have never had a great experience here. Service is not good I unless you are a regular...
1036206	2069601	Way overpriced snacks and drinks! Seems like the guy at the counter makes up prices as he goes. Also, they charge a EXTRA DOLLAR for any food made after 10pm.
1036661	2069745	Stay away from Anthony (tony), monteiro!
1060021	2069745	Whoever said appleee's is better than Tops is obviously nt from around here...
1045015	2069745	Breakfast Taco's! If you love taco's AND bacon\/egg... Do get this at least once!
1053264	2069745	The staff works together as a team to make sure you have the best service! Boyfriend says it like indie when they are setting up a group table. Everything on the menu is supersized and delicious.
1109529	2069745	Red Velvet Pancakes and unlimited coffee. Done.
1253922	2069745	Try the mimosas.
1193062	2069953	They boast a $16 pastrami sandwich, just as the name of the place suggests, a pretentious price, cus although the sandwich is hefty, it's a lil dry and I've tasted tastier pastrami honestly.
1222469	2070160	Get the dinner & a movie special! You can get a discount on your movie tickets and walk to the theatre=)
1234113	2070160	This new bartender dude Marcos kinda looks like a skinnier Tom Hardy

1128912	2070246	The cherry limeade and chili cheese tots are the best!

1038133	2070246	#7 with onion rings and NY dog.
1205530	2070246	Is pretty good

1082569	2070790	Cal Mex has never been better here than at this San Francisco-style burrito joint. The carne asada tacos are one of our faves, bulging with tender marinated steak. Don't forget to spring for the guac
1013128	2070790	Get the burrito, skip the reg plate (this is NOT Chipotle). the tortilla is fresh and has cheese. Get the super hot salsa if you like hot. It's no joke.
1016255	2070790	when asked what type of beans, say \
1082569	2070790	Winner of Best Burrito in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! Spring for the guac topping - it's the perfect addition to the perfect burrito.
1000170	2070790	Probably my favorite taqueria in NYC.
1026066	2070790	Best burrito in the city
1224175	2070790	Best burrito hands down
1027404	2070790	Super-nom and appropriately popular San-Fran style burritos and tacos. Get it extra hot unless you're a wimp.
1013693	2070790	From the clientele and the  food I feel like this is a secret portal to San Francisco.
1024772	2070790	Believe the hype about how hot the hot sauce is.  I-chihuahua, my mouth has been on fire for 15 mins after eating
1036865	2070790	Guac for only 92c? Yes, please!!
1125639	2070790	Try the Carne Asada Tacos - Very good.  (via @Foodspotting)

1196173	2071070	This is a great spot, the food is pretty good, not to mention the prices REALLY GOOD!!! I think there really really cheap.
1091387	2071070	Ask for the pecking duck early because it takes half an hour to make (it's not on the menu). Definitely worth it!!
1036704	2071070	Bad service, low class people, tons of bones in my duck wonton soup, adult couple at table next to me loudly making out. Yeah I won't be eating here again.
1027075	2071070	Most drinks, even top shelf, $4 during happy hour 4pm-8pm. And try the Shrimp dumplings
1004683	2071112	Go before noon or after 2.  Otherwise the line goes out the door and down the street.
1065308	2071112	Always go after 1.30pm to avoid lunch rush
1121273	2071417	Great down-to-earth cooking!
1121273	2071417	Excellent wine and beer (& cider) to accompany your meal.
1148828	2071486	Forget the fresh squeezed juices..Way too overpriced. Best deals are the fresh cut fruit bowls from the fridge by the door. They use fresh cut kiwi, mango, watermelon, papaya, pineapple and grapes!
1032206	2071579	Ask for the day's special!
1026060	2071641	This place is the best.

1077380	2071641	Don't skip the fresh mozzarella or the daily soup specials. Homemade ravioli is amazing!

1090175	2071971	The spicy crunchy tuna is amazing!!
1044778	2071971	Amazing sushi - in both quality and presentation. I think of Loop as a more affordable and more intimate Koi. Reco the spicy tuna on crispy rice to start.
1038431	2071971	Great spot to have lunch on a nice day. Great soundtrack, friendly staff, and enjoyable atmosphere!
1170559	2071971	The 3rd Avenue roll is fabulous.
1049805	2071971	Order a sushi entree, sit back, and prepare for the inescapable food coma.
1193339	2071971	Checking this place out thanks to @Jaimiewatson7...bad news bears bout to put a smile on their face with some sake!
1021452	2072017	Amazing and awesome but if you have more than a few bites be prepared for a sugar coma nap. 1 is enough for 3 ppl.
1014203	2072017	Try the frosted black and white cookie.
1065841	2072073	Have a thai tea, you won't be disappointed!
1115882	2072073	Yummy pad thai and mojitos.... Skip dessert!
1087196	2072073	Iron lamb and coconut rice. AMAZING
1135425	2072073	The bottle service is a rip off. The girl at the door is crazy. And she makes up \
1077887	2072073	Nothing to scream about, unless you are tourist or coming from Jersey Shore to drink for your life in the city...
1049297	2072073	They have Changi beer!
1036721	2072073	The Drunk Man's Noodle is an interesting spicy seafood adventure that I definitely enjoyed.
1141794	2072205	Try the Chicken Salad Bowl - Delish. A classic. With all the works!  (via @Foodspotting)
1031807	2072207	Pricey but yummy!
1042214	2072267	Blue cheese, guacamole, and bacon are great toppings!
1008285	2072593	Try the Cheeseburger with Lettuce, Tomato & Mayo - Awesome! (via @Foodspotting)
1019408	2072623	Surprisingly good chicken on a block with a lot of good chicken. Much better than Big Arc chicken, and maybe not as great as BaoBQ, but that's apples and oranges.
1019408	2072623	Amazing, juicy and tender chicken, great place for take-out and way better than that Big Arc chicken next door. Such bitter competition. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1086519	2072714	Sticking fingers in cups, outrageous lines, ghetto staff...this is by far the WORST Starbucks I have EVER been to...avoid if you can. You will thank me...
1017734	2072714	Welcome to the slowest Sbux in Manhattan!
1033575	2072945	black n white shake is the move!
1000102	2073222	I like the food and drinks, but they play their music on some sort of odd, reverby EQ setting that is very distracting
1000058	2073254	Did you order the bone marrow? If you didn't then you are simply doing it wrong. Flag down your server and correct your mistake.
1029831	2073254	The only place to consider eating late night.
1124588	2073254	Had a great day and an even better night!!!! No worries & no headaches!!!! With great company. Werq
1000156	2073254	Bone marrow. Raw oysters. MAC 12 for desert. Edible genius.
1196154	2073254	a must for bone marrow late night!!
1016602	2073254	Order the bone marrow & fried chicken and go home happy.
1184814	2073304	Love the simple, straight forward atmosphere. Cody's is owned and operated by a former cop. He's a great guy.
1002228	2073304	Pick a sixpoint on draft, baby
1082569	2073405	The chicken pot pie sports a fluffy puff-pastry top, and rich, creamy chicken stew underneath. If you loved Swanson chicken pot pies when you were a kid you'll adore the luxuriance of this rendition.
1196154	2073405	I miss having a place like this in the neighborhood!  For all of you health nuts, pay a visit ASAP!
1180959	2073405	Found a hair in the dish and server was didn't care. Awful service.
1046448	2073512	Definitely try the JoJo sandwhich: chicken cutlet inside a homemade massive garlic bread roll!
1029020	2073512	The spinach wheel and the spinach stuffed pie are orgasmatronic chronic
1038363	2073512	The best pizza in Brooklyn!!
1038363	2073512	The plain slice with sausage is awesome!!
1035434	2073581	Drive thru takes 10-15 mins pet car. :(
1047683	2073848	Solid no frills diner. One of my favorites.
1043127	2073848	This place is really called \
1042214	2073888	Try the meatloaf sandwich!
1014448	2074191	It have doughnuts in the name but I like their egg and cheese sandwiches best.
1002374	2074294	There is absolutely NO justification for the prices they charge. Pizza isn't worth half. Go anywhere else. Seriously.
1166272	2074294	Calzone heaven Spinach and cheese at less then 350 calories YUM YUM YUM
1144261	2074407	Not impressed...
1224242	2074450	Very nice servers
1015492	2074668	Service sucks, waited 15 mins for a drink at an empty bar while the barmaid counted her tips. Oh and the whole restaurant stunk like frumunda cheese. Gross!
1070839	2074668	WORST service ever!
1029099	2074668	The big Jack daddy Burger is the ultimate best!!!
1000616	2074896	Whatever you do, get the baked ricotta.  Pizza is great. Mussels good too. We estimated $50k worth of whiskey on wall - whatchoo think?
1000616	2074896	Whatever pizza you order, throw a fried egg on it. Amazing.
1000072	2074896	whatever you do, drop an egg on your pizza. delicious. if you're not sure which one, perhaps get a pepperoni with egg on top
1082569	2074896	Winner of Best Pizza in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! Summertime means pesca pie, the choice for you salty-sweet lovers.
1016261	2074896	Free wifi!
1001112	2074896	Whatever you do, breakfast here is a delightful ghost town.
1008146	2074896	I'm hooked. Trippa finta alla' amatriciana one of the best egg dishes ever created. On breakfast and brunch menu.
1024772	2074896	Stick with the pizza and baked pastas.  Don't order the green salad, it's $11 for a few lettuce leaves and 1\/4 of a tomato.
1004356	2074896	Use the pepper oil (ask for it or it's already on the table) with your crust - delicious.
1027367	2074896	Try the Margherita - With egg & pancetta. Oozy yolk over everything. Fantastic. Like breakfast bacon & eggs with tomatoe sauce & toast(pizza dough)  (via @Foodspotting)
1027367	2074896	Try the House Gnocchi With Wild Boar Ragu - The boar was melt I yur mouth good. Gnocchi is almost never a bad thing.  (via @Foodspotting)

1188400	2074896	Order the meatball pizza (it's not on the menu).
1026202	2074896	Pizza's solid but make sure you start with the prosciutto. Enough for 2-3 people as a starter.
1159682	2074896	Craving a spicy pizza? This is the spot! \
1178067	2074896	I'm a model, you know what I mean and I do my little turn on the catwalk. On the catwalk, on the catwalk , yeah, I shake my little tush on the catwalk.
1011693	2074923	Great food and the people who work there are wonderful!
1049206	2074923	Omg, get the scallion pancake. AMAZING!!
1027297	2074923	General Tso's chicken is nice a crispy with a little touch of ginger. Yum!
1045808	2075007	Come here with Anthony Liang. Totally different experience.
1006998	2075007	On weekends you can't use laptops on the main section, but you can use them in the library upstairs or at the bar

1205499	2075007	Hot chocolate with marshmallows is the best! Try it!
1003607	2075007	Free wifi for 1 hour with purchase. Great alternative to Starbucks.
1049206	2075007	Go to the library upstairs. It's awesome, but really hot. You need a card from the register for wifi, it's limited to 1 hour as well.
1013693	2075007	great spot to relax
1054561	2075022	The worst service ever. After waiting for my drink for 20 mins, I got a reply, \
1071312	2075029	Best Starbucks. No wait. Great baristas. Never mess up my drink.
1013999	2075029	Pay with your mobile app and leave your wallet at home!
1034386	2075029	The friendliest servers in the city
1197679	2075051	Franchise disguised as a local shop.  They're all the same.  Only a good place to eat if the weather is bad.  Pricey and rather greasy.
1033575	2075206	I have a bad feeling about this...
1047663	2075282	Very loud here I think due to the high ceilings. The sound just bounces around and echos. Don't come here to get any work done or bring noise cancelling headphones.
1026202	2075338	The don't take American Express, unfortunate.
1028925	2075371	Best frozen yogurt spot in NYC hands down. Pinkberry is so overrated.
1140970	2075371	At Phileo (formerly YogurtLand) you can choose from different flavored fro yo & add as many toppings as you want. Also they charge you by weight, not by size.

1096349	2075835	Coffeholic yayyy great place :)
1087874	2075835	It's true the line from 8:30-9a  can be long but they tend to overstaff then and are really good about getting everyone through fast.
1217167	2075955	Great variety of sandwiches! I got the Tuscan and it was great, huge hero.. I saved the other half for later and it was still good!!

1012791	2076162	Food isn't that great. Last time coming here.
1082569	2076187	For Choice Eats, they brought mini salted pretzels, mini gruyere-smoked paprika pretzels, mini 7 chili pretzels served with whole grain mustard, honey mustard & horseradish-beet mayo. So tasty!
1082569	2076187	Must try the smoked salmon, cream cheese, and cucumber sandwich-it's #50 on Fork in the Road's \
1000616	2076187	Open till 10p  Get a pretzel with cream cheese on yer way home from wherever!

1000836	2076187	The salmon sandwich is perfect. Nom nom nom.
1006088	2076405	Foursquare special is standard pricing, not actually a special.
1028032	2076554	Hands down the best 'fast food' burger you'll ever eat. I'll be back.
1018596	2076554	Fire roasted veggie burger is tasty! And fries are must have, too.
1033575	2076581	Yummo Panko breadcrumbs under the crust!!!!
1008051	2076581	AVOID if possible. This pizza spot is overpriced and underwhelming, persisting by drunk patrons alone.
1025807	2076770	Longest line in the world filled with college students. Basically it's the daytime version of Williamsburg or the LES - just substitute alcohol for caffeine.
1029320	2076770	Not really that great if you don't have an NYU meal plan to spend, but it's so close to campus it's hard to turn down for convince sake.
1197679	2076770	Closed on Saturdays and Sundays in the summer.
1216811	2076770	probably the rudest workers you'll encounter. The prices seem to vary by day
1125639	2076770	Try the Very Berry Coffee Cake - Pretty good... But it's Starbucks :\/ (via @Foodspotting)
1217394	2076770	All Xmas latte flavors (caramel brûlée, gingerbread, pumpkin spice) are sooooo good!!!
1000129	2076770	This tip was brought to you by the electrical outlet here that works.
1068295	2076770	They have holiday pastries now!
1195788	2076770	Big a big smile you always have better service :D
1226566	2076770	It's run by NYU so no Starbucks card purchases or free wifi (you have to be an NYU student.)
1040642	2076770	There is no FREE wi-fi here. What's up with that?
1033463	2076901	Strawberry Surf Rider all the way!
1033463	2076901	There's a 'Secret Menu' with awesome drinks like 'Pink Starburst' and 'Chocolate Covered Strawberry'. They're both awesome!
1028925	2076901	Order Pink Starburst. One of the many flavors from the secret menu.

1017435	2077083	it's all about balance and this place gets it right. get a sandwich and the ratio of \
1082569	2077086	We recommend making your next sandwich with Orwasher's beer bread, especially for those unwilling to crack open a brew during their lunch break.
1193062	2077086	Got some Sufganiyot here for my boss, looked so good couldn't pass them up, a little pricey but were a huge hit at work, yummy as can be of course too.
1193062	2077086	they make a mean hot apple cider during the winter, hits the spot
1022829	2077199	The frozen yogurt is pretty good.
1009253	2077986	Portions are enormous so order well
1017435	2077986	get the dough flakes with chicken broth. do not bother with the seafood soup. overall, this place gets a C in my book.
1018406	2078005	I left this place, they served me rotten meat, grotesque!!!
1014842	2078005	Two.words. Crackling chicken.
1028925	2078067	Babaganoush is babababangin here. The owner was really nice too.
1051971	2078067	I always try to have something different, but the goat cheese salad is just too good!
1009253	2078067	No coffee here :-(
1042214	2078081	Try the fettuccine with salmon. It's delicious. Their service is very friendly and amazingly fast.
1103216	2078081	Been searching for olive tapenade for a long time. Finally I found they serve it here with your bread in a tomato paste. A wonderful pairing up. Great with a dry white wine.
1026168	2078297	Some of the employees are amazing. Some.
1016028	2078422	The pumpkin pancakes are DELICIOUS!
1050730	2078624	$1 pizza.  Perfect drunk food.
1036721	2078624	They sell Hookahs and shisha!
1078141	2078642	Great fish and one of my favorite brunch places. Also has Jazz on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
1030998	2078902	A new addition is their Vegetarian and Pork & Vegetable Gyoza & Shumai in a machine in the heart of the restaurant's dining area. Don't miss it! Try all four kinds served in it!
1038272	2078902	Be very careful with raw seafood (crab, oyster) sometimes they're not fresh.
1231094	2079077	Best Pizza in 5 Boroughs hands down! The only people that disagree are the cheapskates!
1121273	2079077	Exceptional thin crust pizza!
1153770	2079077	Worth the trip!
1169728	2079077	Best on pizza on staten Island however but don't come for ten bucks off!
1054405	2079077	Try the vodka pie - amazing!
1028196	2079240	Best of the 3 locations in New York. Prepare yourself for large portions and lots of salsa music. The red sangria is a must, by the pitcher, it's sweeter that way ;)
1036551	2079240	Churrasco (skirt steak) was delicious - drinks were tasty, strong and reasonably priced and the appetizer chicken wings were great.

1035591	2079541	Its like everyone here has never been to an sbux before. Damn tourists!
1087874	2079541	Agree that the morning is always slammed. Great that they finally have someone out expediting orders for the line.  Makes all the difference.
1002442	2079541	if you are looking for a starbucks for their bathrooms, don't go to this one. not sure how or why, but they actually do not have bathrooms for customers.
1116122	2079862	Donuts are made on site and are often more fresh than at other Dunkin Donuts in the neighborhood.  The morning crew on the weekend is extremely friendly and will remember your order.
1116122	2079862	If you get the veggie flatbread, ask for it extra toasted - when they send it through the toaster just once it isn't quite enough.
1111137	2079880	Worst service. I am wondering why they are wearing Starbucks uniform.
1226771	2079908	Happy hour! Shrimp corndog and lobster slider!

1043388	2079908	try the Kushi
1027404	2079919	Expensive (especially considering the healthier, more appropriate portions), but super noms.
1072170	2079919	Breakfast wraps are pretty tasty and filling and only $3.26 (incl. tax) right now. Thai Chicken Wrap & Ostrich burger are also satisfying. Smoothies = not worth the calories\/points.
1023621	2079919	If you like waiting a long time for your food, Energy Kitchen is the place to be.
1049206	2079919	Sit at one of the couches and you can steal the starbucks wifi. It's awesome.
1196154	2079919	always coming here for the bison burgers.  delicious.  Also awesome breakfast burritos.
1020714	2079919	Try the Tex-Mex wrap. Very good.
1196173	2079919	Really good food, friendly and courteous staff!
1196173	2079919	Just had the chicken fajita wrap, pretty good. And the best part it only had 384 cal.
1077887	2079919	What, they went to hunt that bison to Alaska?
1066227	2079919	Bison egg wrap is pretty good. Just needs some hot sauce.
1134523	2079997	Totally disagree with slow service comments. I'm here every single morning and they are always moving it!
1061424	2080350	WOW... You need to try Two Moms In The RAW Organic Blueberry Granola - Freakin' Amazing!
1024915	2080406	mini cucumber cream cheese sandwich is a great snack
1087874	2080564	The two patty special is a winner every time and a pineapple soda goes great with the spicy patty.
1000616	2080645	Brunch here is great.  Whatever you do, get the biscuits and the honey butter.  (and maybe a side order of bacon)
1082569	2080645	Village Voice is excited to have Northern Spy Food Co. at the 2012 ChoiceEats food fest!  Full list of restaurants here: http:\/\/ow.ly\/8QjDQ
1024436	2080645	best brunch in the hood - definitely get the biscuits w\/ homemade jam to start, slow whisked scrambled eggs with bacon, and the deliciously fresh green salad. top it off with a cucumber mint spritzer!
1019732	2080645	They sell all sorts of locally made products like @liddabit sweets and early bird granola. Get em!
1082569	2080645	Can't go wrong with the Sunday dinner special, and might I recommend the chicken thigh sandwich?
1044309	2080645	Hey ask me to clear my plate 20 times. I feel really welcome. Thanks! Good food tainted tacky, hover-y service.
1025152	2080645	They chill their Gamay!!!!!!!!!
1044739	2080645	Sunday Supper special. You'll leave stuffed!
1089566	2080645	Awesomely fresh food. Kale salad is a must. Buttermilk biscuits w apple butter and pork sticky rolls are addictive. Wash it all down w a shandy. Must return for lamb burger. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1256098	2080645	Be sure to try a Spy Cup.
1003744	2080645	Try the Slow Whisked Scrambled Eggs (via @Foodspotting)
1034434	2080645	The strawberry-rhubarb seltzer is wonderful! Same flanked are in the Honeymoon in Red cocktail, also good.
1016255	2080645	Not on the menu but order the cucumber mint spritzer for brunch
1181940	2080645	Love the food, hate the wine tumblers and wait attitude
1000953	2080645	Unimpressed with the chicken-egg sandwich.
1018993	2080769	Warm blueberry muffins are clutch.
1049343	2080769	Steak sandwich - baguette was nice and fresh, steak was a little dry.  Fries were cold.
1034476	2080844	TERRIBLE FOOD. You might get lucky and get a hair in your pizza.
1183355	2080844	Keep walking! DON'T STOP. Eff this place. And check my tips - I'm never this upset to give negative review. Bunch of lazy ass, rude, crooks!
1082569	2080866	This Choice Eats attendee in 2010 brought Tocino (sugar-achuete cured pork) sliders in purple yam rolls with grated green mango and Chicken\/Pork adobo skewers.
1047769	2080866	Not a place you want to go if you want authentic Filipino cuisine
1027682	2081096	Where are the burritos?
1082569	2081254	Anything with poached eggs is mind-blowingly delicious at this cafe!
1001509	2081254	Holy smokes the baked goods are nom-nom-nom delicious. Not to be missed.
1013880	2081254	Sit at the bar on the far left, watch the room. For breakfast I recommend the eggs in spicy tomato sauce. It will wake you right up.
1005347	2081254	Impacable food, impecable service. Have to come back to try suckling pig.
1005183	2081254	The pork with crackling is in the top 3 \
1023793	2081254	Get everything! Seating at the bar if the resto is full, make sure to put your name in though to be added to the roster. Very accommodating and delicious food!
1196154	2081254	The Roman Trattoria of the moment.  Danny Meyer never ceases to amaze with stellar food and the best service standard in New York City.  Peppered chicken on Arugula. So simple, so good.
1024873	2081254	Try the Americitriana - Amazing! Spicy eggs and tomato sauce (via @Foodspotting)
1175941	2081254	The maialino pork was very disappointing. It came with a side of hash browns. Yes, hash browns. Next.
1029831	2081254	Actually preferred Brunch to any other meal here!
1103741	2081254	One of the best Italian restaurants in Manhattan - amazing cochinillo!
1023134	2081254	A really good Panino Indiavolato!

1038701	2081284	The presentation of the oysters and sashimi sampler are unreal! Check them out.
1016769	2081284	One of the best tasting menus in the city. Can't go wrong with the crispy asparagus, oriental salad or sliced kobe beef.Their green tea crepe is outstanding.
1000104	2081357	This place is for real. Just get the Cubano sandwich and you'll know what I mean.
1006741	2081357	The seafood soup. Seriously.
1068409	2081383	It's all about the 7 oz. burgers.  Get a classic combo or go crazy w\/ the toppings.  Waffle fries & shakes hit the spot too!  Open until 1:30 am on the weekends! - MichelleC.tv
1021380	2081579	OVERPRICED, last time i bought real food, made me sick
1082569	2081616	Try the classic bistro salad frisée aux lardons. Break the egg so that the lemon yellow yolk flows out, and mix it all together into a smoky, sticky mess. It's probably the best salad of the year.
1000072	2081616	go really hungry and get the pork ribs (so salty!), fried cauliflower (whoa! i am a fan of cauliflower once again) and the corn (to balance the two sides). you'll probably take some of it home
1082569	2081616	The Village Voice voted this Best Tripe in our Best Of New York Poll!
1002839	2081616	Ribs were excellent, but portions small for \
1000072	2081616	to drink, the lady should order up a seven spice sour and the gentleman, bull in the heather (you can't go wrong with the mix of glenrothes, absinthe and honey)
1073138	2081616	yumm. must. go. now
1001771	2081616	Go with a group so you can say, \
1232655	2081616	Get the vegetarian tofu summer rolls as an appetizer. They are light and tasty.
1125665	2081695	they have a pumpkin pancake for fall itssss spook yummy n breakfast served ALL day ;)
1013999	2081766	They have hot pre-made soups so you don't have to wait in line. It's to the right after you enter.
1073774	2081766	You can't go wrong w\/ the soup & sammy combo. Upsize the soup for a buck!
1116296	2081766	this is it
1048682	2081771	Don't miss the gnochi with spinach

1028925	2081990	Get the Pad See Ew! They throw in some Korean flavor with the galbi and mango kimchi goodness! The pad thai is really good too with a yolky poached egg on top for you to mix around!
1050377	2081990	Pad see ew with green mango kimchi
1028925	2081990	Pad see ew with a Korean twist: Galbi and Mango Kimchi! What! So good!
1038456	2081990	Very bad service. At one point, the ENTIRE crew just sat to eat together!! We had to work hard to get their attention for some service, and when the waitress came, she treated us as we disturbed her.
1147510	2082051	atmosphere is off the hook!!
1047830	2082254	Egg white english muffin and tuna salad with a wheat bagel is good for gym rats looking to get a protein fix.
1019408	2082328	??????????????The best (and most underrated) soup dumplings in NYC, big juicy and cheap as hell.
1178106	2082328	very generous quantity
1043293	2082328	Get here early for first dibs at a highly-coveted table for Taiwanese breakfast. Don't leave without soup dumplings, and lots of them.

1030685	2082419	I've had several parties here and we never leave disappointed. And it's quiet enough to hear your conversation!
1068370	2082441	Paul, the store manager, is awesome!
1017238	2082634	Lamb is my fav.which is a hit or miss sometimes. Tender or tough... Go in and sit the service is decent and they have a flat screen with the latest bollywood music hits.  The portions are big too.
1017238	2082634	Best Indian in the neighborhood or the only one.
1257034	2082660	Finish everything or get yelled at (speaking from experience)
1068595	2082660	Decent quality... They yell at you if you don't finish everything. And if they think you are initially over ordering they use their own judgement on what to actually bring you ! -_-
1020178	2083038	Don't expect the employees to talk to you. If I worked here I'd hate my life too.
1026197	2083182	Pepperoni and hot pepper pizza is the best!
1026197	2083182	The pepperoni and hot pepper combo is awesome!
1260093	2083925	Excellent food!
1235080	2083925	This place pretends to be a Jersey diner.
1261090	2084006	Very slow staff whent there to eat and it was empty not a regular busy night and it took me more 5 min to get a table I just walk away.
1043127	2084088	Overall: meh. Relatively expensive for what you get.
1019863	2084088	Their Martinis are great. Just had their lobster BLT...yum.

1261843	2084091	Half off appetizers are awesome! I always get their delicious calamari and mussels. Their drinks are pretty good as well like the lychee or white gummy bear martinis.
1033330	2084145	No liquor license at the \
1145041	2084145	Get there early on a Sunday..they don't take reservations but the wait is well worth it!

1038431	2084394	The Miami roll is really good!
1024511	2084770	Heaping helping of sweet potato fries is awesome. Just beware--the buffalo chicken sandwich is drenched in buffalo sauce.

1027460	2084770	California Wrap is great.

1014716	2084910	The Eskimo dessert and mocha cupcakes with hot ovaltin
1000953	2084910	Nice new Vietnamese tea n ice cream place. My 1st NYC apt is upstairs.

1202698	2084910	Thai ice tea creme brulee is awesome!
1049805	2084910	Come with a small group of friends and order the Omakase - a complete sampler of all their tapas, cookies, and ice creams for only $50!
1011466	2084910	They should be playing A.N.Jell in the background. Or the equivalent crooning Asian boy band.
1002621	2084910	They are changing their menu this week.  I hope the coconut crema is still around afterwards!
1005503	2084972	Split the fries. You won't finish them unless... You're a giant or dinasour
1109529	2085008	Worth the drive from Jersey City, better than Brownstone in every way!

1204517	2144620	Get the coffee cake flavored coffee when they have it! Smooth & sweet
1052864	2144773	Get the Seared Tuna Roll. It's amazing!
1006886	2144773	The eggplant entry is pretty good.
1082569	2145078	Try the potato, egg, & provolone on a roll-delicately scrambled eggs, provolone, chunks of roasted red potatoes, & roasted red peppers squish together deliciously, seasoned with salt and black pepper.
1043127	2145078	People who hold a table before even ordering really suck!
1001163	2145078	Incredible Chicken Parm
1079142	2145078	Try the Italian Combo Hero (via @Foodspotting)

1043127	2145078	Sooo good. Chicken parm is off the hook! Potato & egg is awesome. Next time going to try the spicy turkey.
1010525	2145286	Get a multigrain bagel toasted with vegetable tofu cream cheese. INCREDIBLE. Seriously.
1048751	2145607	Rigotini Carbonara is delish. The meat is a bit too salty tho. The pizza is really good; thin sliced.

1038133	2145771	Awesome food, best spanish food for miles.. Best steaks as well.. try the twin lobsters, they'll bring you three. I go here often for cocktails and oysters..
1105277	2145830	the best atmosphere...
1196154	2145830	Try the eel and foie gras terrine, and the tempura fried poached egg with three kinds of caviar.  Also, the amadai is worthy of a mention as well!
1153818	2145830	Try the burgers. Hands down the best in NY. Why this restaurant is not on the best burger list, I dont know.
1082569	2146020	They brought Mixed Seafood Fried Rice and International Mafé (Peanut Stew) to Choice Eats
1031943	2146020	It's ALL about the Danish cheese. That is all. ?
1009566	2146357	The Coconut mini baklava is to die... but you have to be stern when you are ordering. The staff isn't really the nicest but after a while they get to know you.
1000429	2147002	The Porterhouse
1020401	2147002	One of the best steakhouses in NYC!

1020401	2147002	In honor of the 2010 Winter Olympics, try the sizzling Canadian bacon.
1023357	2148051	They have Blue Moon on tap!
1143431	2148051	Happy will up sell you on a shot of jack with your beer. DO IT!
1131576	2148051	American food. Little bit of everything. I had coconut shrimp and mash potatoes. Just the right portion size.
1015206	2148156	This one is a bit small but the staff is great they know my drink and call it out when i walk in
1001342	2148156	Say thank you & vote for \
1087196	2148402	Best pizza on 9th ave

1078275	2149539	Delicious smoothies, great late night spot.
1175163	2149539	Double check your order. They gave me reg Coke instead of diet. They gave me honey mustard dressing instead of ranch. Other than that, the food was really good.
1015272	2149539	There is some magical ingredient in their  Rigatoni Bolognese that makes it the best in the city!!!
1063524	2149541	if you like your wings on the crispy side, texas does it RIGHT
1048682	2149658	Come for lunch and get the reasonably priced chopped steak.

1215619	2150436	Milkshakes & fries a must.
1017982	2151310	Ice coffee is more expensive then other dunkin' donuts
1017982	2151310	The ice cream cakes seem to be in the freezer to long.
1043734	2151325	It's official.  I'm addicted to Atomic Wings.
1069788	2151325	Best bar in the neighborhood!
1243427	2151325	Great wings
1043734	2151325	Isa & Adrianna are da bomb.  Best waitresses in the city.
1043734	2151325	Apparently not all Atomic Wings are created equal. Midtown 1140 Second Av is HORRIBLE. Nothing at all like the fantastic Blue Room.
1043734	2151325	...and don't forget the combo waffle fries and onion rings. You would be hard pressed to find any better.
1043734	2151325	Best damn wings...anywhere!
1196173	2151376	Really nice comfortable atmosphere, gotta try the mixed drinks!

1154317	2151956	Must try Red Velvet Waffle when they serve it as a special!
1033330	2151956	Split a plate w\/ someone the portions are too much.
1066463	2152096	If they ever get rid of the bums I'd actually have a place to sit and eat!
1034872	2152109	Nice old Greek dinner downtown, great food, lots of locals
1006318	2152109	This is the place that time forgot. it's old, not dirty. Vintage. Comfy. Here, reporters wear fedoras!
1098972	2152402	Try the Fresh Home-Made Mushroom Ravioli & savour the moment with a Sangria.
1008051	2152402	It's OK to ask for more Parmesan cheese.  Drink the Sangria.
1000072	2153035	for some reason, i always get the chicken and gyro combo platter. it's like breakfast, lunch and snacktime all in one and you cannot resist
1254822	2154789	Def go on live music nights and ask for John's section- he's the best!  Have the black eyed pea soup and save room for the bread pudding!
1029301	2155079	Daft punk goes surprisingly well with tacos and sangria. Definitely try the pomegranate skirt steak tacos!!
1193062	2155079	Got the mahi mahi tacos, pretty decent but pretty small, not truly worth the 10 bucks.
1102715	2155221	Weird... The service I got was pretty nice, and they served me with a smile. Can't understand from where the complaints come from...
1186394	2155221	Very nice & clean... then you can go shopping on 42nd Street Time Square
1008083	2155929	Go with the classic citrus squeeze. It's not on the menu.
1017228	2156193	This place is ghetto fab
1002308	2156193	Always eat before the Yankee game
1038363	2156362	Blueberry Scones are delish.
1131875	2156396	It's heavy and juicy ! But still yummy
1014203	2156396	I recommend a cheeseburger with raw onions. You can skip the fries; they're nothing to write home about.
1150051	2156402	The tomato soup is really good, but I would only order a small, or it becomes too much. Getting your sandwich toasted might take an extra 10 minutes, but it's better that way.
1173942	2156910	Ask for the Chef's table
1024873	2156910	Try the Apple crumble a la mode - Third course...nom nom nom (via @Foodspotting)

1024873	2156910	Try the Artisnal Pasta - First course nom  (via @Foodspotting)
1012246	2156910	Unimpressed. Unfortunately, food was uninspiring, wine prices for the same wine were more expensive than I've seen elsewhere, and the service was merely fine.
1119217	2156910	A NYC Classic!  Everyone should experience Le Cirque at least once!
1021380	2157043	friendly and nice, try the portobella mushroom salad and the turkish tea

1029020	2158279	went there today , food was done well
1076531	2158279	Far and away the most delicious won ton soup in the world.
1021652	2158746	Great sandwiches, and great prices!
1036202	2158746	Hot sandwiches are decent but overpriced. Generally overpriced, bad quality food
1009566	2158958	The french toast bagel and hazelnut cream cheese is better than anything
1015247	2159042	One of the best tasting menus in NYC. Or, well, anywhere. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1049766	2159042	s'mores are legendary!  Salt Cod fritters are also a must
1063386	2159042	Adorable and quaint! Get the hamachi app and lobster risotto or scallops!
1015416	2159042	I recommend the Salt Cod Fritters, Chilled Corn Soup, Lobster Risotto, and don't leave without the Smores!
1193062	2159367	Probably the best and most diverse sushi served in the city, features a chef's choice menu....will cost you $200 for dinner for two.
1120838	2159635	Free tapas with every drink after 5- amazing!
1050152	2159635	Deceiving. The \

1215956	2160273	Heard them charge a customer for a cup of tap water :-|
1188400	2160446	Sit under the heat vents to stay warm when it's cold out.
1004787	2161178	Cuban Chinese food. Find a better place and I'll be there. Good food, good service, not cheap. Mixed drinks are surprisingly awesome.
1004787	2161178	Chicken. With. Cashew. Nuts. Ummmm, yes!
1135804	2161404	Food was great
1049783	2161625	Its all about the supa dupa greens

1035764	2165050	Get the grandma slice. Incredible.
1082569	2166305	Winner of Best Italian (Neighborhood) in the Village Voice 2011 Best Of issue! The old-school baked pasta dishes are the perfect winter food.
1109481	2166334	Try the Two Dogs \
1004787	2166526	Nice beer. Nice food. Not expensive. Crowd is usually friendly. Bartenders are pretty cool.
1004787	2166526	Beer good. Food bad. Service worse. Maybe the worst Bloody Mary I've ever had. Told us halfway through brunch that the credit card machine was down. Won't be back. Go to Sanford's for brunch instead.
1012068	2168590	Really friendly staff!
1015414	2168590	Step on a cockroach ask for a free latte!

1003812	2168672	No seats...it's like express starbucks.
1001342	2168672	Say thank you & vote for \
1207922	2168672	VERY small location. You can barely walk and squeeze in there much of the time. Despite that the service here is definitely fast and efficient. The staff here are always been warm and pleasant to me.
1120838	2168809	The brunch is great- try the huevos rancheros with  rosalita cocktail (hibiscus margarita)
1154689	2168809	Try the Huevos rancheros - Best I've ever had. Perfectly crispy & spicy. (via @Foodspotting)
1007293	2168809	Get the classic margarita. Better than the house hibiscus.

1082569	2170256	Birdbath Bakery's chocolate chip cookie perfectly straddles the crispy-chewy divide, and packs enough butter and chocolate to incapacitate an elephant
1225770	2170256	Farcical service. Watch as everything falls apart
1000104	2170256	Their chocolate chocolate chunk cookie is so good I almost gobbled it up before I had a chance to write this tip. Like chocolate? Get one.
1023442	2170256	cookies. all of them. many of them.

1071476	2170319	Shell steak is great if your afraid to try something -- grab a thai iced tea too
1036245	2170651	Basically the middle eastern answer to Chipotle. Wrap, bowl or salad with plenty of sauces and toppings to choose from
1030546	2170651	Sometimes you just gotta go double meat. too good.
1003021	2170700	Great place...inexpensive lunch
1043388	2170700	Good pan-Asian. Great quality to price ratio. Decor is awesome.
1048083	2170700	Still like food @ Room Service in Chelsea a bit better, but this place is damn good & gets a few more points for ambience over R.S.  Quality of food for price is hard to beat!
1024511	2170700	Get the Tom Yum soup. It is properly spicy. Get the Larb too, though it is NOT properly spicy. Thai iced tea is a ripoff in those skinnyass glasses.
1066456	2170700	Excellent pad thai! Can't wait to try other dishes
1022056	2170700	Very good cocktails, especially @ $6 during HH. Food incredibly inexpensive and I have to say, excellent value. Good portions for the money. Very cool space. Thai samosa a standout

1054459	2170700	Steamed Ginger sea bass w\/ glass noodles is yummy!
1015440	2170835	Service is as good as the handmade sandwiches. Try the roastbeef on wheat. Olive oil on sandwich is top tier.
1022365	2170835	best sandwiches and salads in chelsea....<3
1015760	2170936	Three Lentil Soup is a must if you come here. It's spicy, vegetarian and delicious! Ask to try it first.
1028938	2171348	Lots of tv screens in the Tap Room will keep you entertained while waiting for your meal
1028938	2171348	I love the Pals salad without onions or croutons & dressing on the side.
1138182	2171348	Luscious foodies esp steaks, but they have poor customer service.
1008388	2171730	Try the mozzarella!
1220081	2171730	Ask for the cannoli's with coffe & a shot of espresso #ToDieFor
1175941	2171730	The steak salad is tasty. And look for Brian & Wai sitting at the bar. They're fixtures.
1019965	2171959	they uaed to have an \
1019965	2171959	Food was alright mgmt was a jerk
1023050	2171965	You've gotta try the basil chicken dumplings as an appetizer. Also...the entrees are more filling than they first appear. Take it slow. (That's what she said.)
1143828	2171965	Red Curry equals Amazingness, but watch out! Über-spicy!!!!
1043130	2171965	Combo Green -- so good!

1084147	2172514	Try the sausage and eggs platter.
1043081	2172793	Try the Big N' Toasty. Most delicious breakfast sandwiches available!
1242978	2173414	The barista is really good on getting a mouthful worth of a customized order ^^
1003982	2173702	Best coffee. <3
1015416	2173702	Love the hit and run. Just wish they stayed open later... (hint!)

1066871	2174200	The French toast is incredible!
1247092	2174371	The fresh squeezed apple juice is tasty
1000312	2174401	Balthazar croissants and scones
1029301	2174401	Basically the perfect latte can be had here.
1038456	2175522	Lousy service and unfriendly staff. Double espresso was dull. Grilled cheese focaccia was decent.
1031304	2175522	Coffee is avg. but egg sandwiches are solid and they also have smoothies. Seating inside is nice and usually not crowded. Not a place with 20 phonies on macs.
1060601	2175670	If you're a meat eat, get any of the breaded \
1020711	2175670	Their food is great and they've got an amazing vegan carrot cake.

1050730	2175685	A very good sandwich shop tucked away in the back of Chelsea Market.
1052984	2175904	I've been here 3 times in the last 2 days and they have yet to get my coffee order right and I'm not even asking for anything difficult.
1076627	2176025	Worth the wait, best coffee you'll ever have
1048133	2176425	birthday cake ice cream! get a kiddy sized cup- manageable indulgence!

1057056	2179947	25% off on Mondays & Tuesdays thru Feb 15!

1144261	2181750	Avoid this place from 11-3
1082569	2181971	Skip the more elaborate stuff at Okeanos, and stick to the simple, Greek dishes, foremost among them the whole grilled fish. The sardines are a great choice, but so is the pearly-fleshed striped bass.
1068155	2182400	Cute no frills french cafe with outdoor seating
1047895	2182731	Best AUTHENTIC Italian in Northern NJ. Bar none!

1006243	2183663	Be sure your order one of everything including the 3-4 dessert options. One of my favorite restaurants in NYC
1050489	2183825	I have been to almost a dozen Greek places in Astoria and this one is the best.  Awesome octopus, delicious spreads, great fried Herring and great sausage. (4 of 4 petals via Fondu)
1015416	2183876	Fish Tacos!

1004787	4133943	Wish I could tell you how the food is here. They said it was over an hour wait for a table when the place was half full. If that's how they manage the front I'd hate to know how they manage the back.
1004787	4133943	They don't like kids in this place. More than half the tables were empty and they told us that it was an hour wait once they saw our carriage. Shady. One girl told us not to eat here, said it was bad.
